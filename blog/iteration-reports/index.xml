&lt;p>We continue to focus on the Lenape project as we push it towards completion and soft-launch. We implemented the dedication on the tree, and also completed several UI cleanup items and other chores.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For the second iteration in a row, we were able to focus all of our efforts on the Lenape Timetree project as we work to get it over the finish line, and we made significant progress, completing 27 points and 26 issues across design and development work. On the design side, we finished 18 points and 13 issues for a rolling velocity of 9.7; major efforts included the footer, work on visual identity, and 404 error page designs. On the development side, we closed 9 points and 13 issues, bringing our rolling velocity up to 4. The main functionality completed is a collection of user stories related to tag interactions within the timetree.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All our effort went towards the Lenape Timetree project as we work to get it over the finish line. There isn&amp;rsquo;t as much visible progress in terms of closed issues as we might hope. Development velocity is &lt;strong>2.3&lt;/strong> with 2 points and 7 issues closed, and design velocity is &lt;strong>7.7&lt;/strong> with 2 issues closed. The development points are low in part to the number of design implementation, which we typically track as chores when they are not easily articulable as user-facing features. We have a large number of issues in progress, which hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to complete early this iteration and get a better estimate of how much work is left.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we were able to focus entirely on the Lenape Timetree project. We continued with significant progress on the design work. On the implementation side, we made progress on network layout adjustments, a new visual debug mode to help understand and improve the layout, and some visual cleanup. Design rolling velocity is &lt;strong>11.7&lt;/strong>; development rolling velocity is &lt;strong>5.7&lt;/strong> but only 1 point and 3 development issues were closed, in part due to partial team stafing during the iteration.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this iteration, PPA 3.9 was released, which includes a major improvement to search functionality so that similar works or reprints are clustered by default (the relevant functionality was tested and accepted the previous iteration). On the Lenape Timetree project, major design issues were accomplished for tag and leaf interactions. We also completed the first-pass implementation on the active leaf styles, hover interactions for corresponding leaf and labels, and url behavior that makes it possible to bookmark the tree with a specific leaf showing. We also contributed to some small bugfixes and a major indexing speed improvement for the Geniza project — work that was previously left in-progress, and benefited from a recent discovery made while working on PPA that made it possible to optimize the database queries used for bulk indexing (indexing all Geniza documents went from somewhere around 20-30 minutes to ~2 minutes.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our rolling development velocity is stable, at &lt;strong>7 points&lt;/strong>, but this is due to the large number of points closed in the previous iteration when we completed the PPA search clustering functionality. We only completed &lt;strong>4 points&lt;/strong> of development work in the current iteration. The design velocity is on an upward trend, with two very productive iterations in a row, reflecting the substantial amount of design progress on the Lenape Timetree project in recent weeks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At long last, we finally completed the PPA issues for clustering search results by default, after multiple rounds of testing, and addressing a few regressions introduced by the changes.
A new version of parasolr (0.9) has been released with the needed grouping functionality,
and we expect to release a new version of PPA with the functionality early this iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the Lenape Timetree project, we&amp;rsquo;ve made tremendous progress on design work for leaves in various states and other interactions, and saw some progress on improving the layout of the tree (multiline labels, adjusted leaf sizes, adjusted sizing for century bands.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of the large PPA work that was finally completed, we closed &lt;strong>12&lt;/strong> development points for a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>6.67&lt;/strong> — up significantly from preceding iterations, but probably higher than we expect going forward.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The only project with issues closed this iteration is the Lenape Princeton Timetree. We made progress on a number of design issues, and completed features to represent the data points as leaves and embed images in leaf details. There was some progress on
PPA to address issues found in testing, but the work was stalled with problems updating the staging site to deliver for retesting. Our rolling development velocity is &lt;strong>3.67&lt;/strong> and holding pretty steady for now around three points.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration, we completed a lot of design and development work on Lenape. We also made progress on PPA, but there is a complicated group of related features that needs a few small changes after the most recent round of testing; we hope to complete those and deliver them to production in the coming iteration. The low development velocity (&lt;strong>3 points&lt;/strong>) is consistent over the last few weeks, but significantly impacted by the amount of team member time spent on teaching for Wintersession and H+DSI.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tracking early January as a short iteration for reporting purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We made some progress on PPA and Lenape Timetree; we also completed some chores related to Ansible, including the replication playbook that has been in use in draft status for months and a task to update vault passwords due to the recent LastPass breach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also have work nearly complete enabling contractor deploy for Princeton Geniza Project. The issue is not tracked here because the pull request is still under review, but the new setup was used successfully for version 4.12 of Geniza listed below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We fixed a couple of bugs on Princeton Geniza Project and tagged deployed a micro release to get the fixes into production. We also made some progress on the Lenape Timetree project. It isn&amp;rsquo;t reflected in the closed issues listed below, but we did make significant progress on PPA development work; we simply were not able to deliver for testing or close the issues.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a busy time of year and we had a lot of other work going on in the past two that impacted what we were able to complete in terms of development and design work. For development, we closed 3 points and 13 issues for a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>5.3&lt;/strong> points. Design work is in progress, but none of it was completed since we&amp;rsquo;re still ramping back up on work that was paused.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lenape-timetree">Lenape timetree&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re finally starting to make more progress, including deciding who will review and sign off on development and design work for the project. We completed one story for the algorithmic layout of the leaves in the timetree, and completed some chores that will help set us up to work more efficiently moving forward (visual review with Percy, automated Lighthouse checks for accessibility, SEO, and page efficiency).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ppa">PPA&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Following up on our recent migration, we closed a number of chores and bugs (some of which were resolved by the migration). We didn&amp;rsquo;t complete the major next feature because other commitmennts didn&amp;rsquo;t give us enough time to follow up on tackling something so complex.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed a couple of bug fixes, two of which were introduced in the last release. Hopefully we can release a micro update with those bug fixes and get them out to production soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note:&lt;/em> starting this iteration, we&amp;rsquo;re adding a new ignored tag, &lt;code>performant&lt;/code>. Issues with this label will be included in the list of closed issues but ignored when summarizing work completed and calculating velocity, since that work is being completed by a contractor and not done by this team.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We completed a couple of major things before the Thanksgiving holiday — completed the PPA migration to PUL infrastructure, and completed the dataset export work for PGP. We
completed &lt;strong>12&lt;/strong> development points for a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>5.33&lt;/strong> - the low velocity is due to the number of chores required to complete the PPA migration. We also finally completed the charter for the Lenape Timetree project, and will be circulating it to project stakeholders soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-prosody-archive">Princeton Prosody Archive&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed the last few steps for the migration, released version &lt;strong>3.8.1&lt;/strong> and switched the production site over so it is running on PUL infrastructure. We&amp;rsquo;ve already completed some initial upgrades (python version) that are easier to manage now, and are circling back to in-progress that wasn&amp;rsquo;t completed when PPA was in active development in August.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-geniza-project">Princeton Geniza Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released version &lt;strong>4.11&lt;/strong> with a few search improvements needed to decommission PGPv3 and completed work on dataset exports which will be the basis for published datasets from the project data. We also setup Zenodo sync for the codebase, registering a DOI and adding a citation file to make the code more citable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also have a large number of old issues that were closed thanks to some work from PGP project managers going through and reviewing — some of them have already been addressed, others are duplicates, and others are no longer priorities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The points completed in the last iteration are low due to staffing
and the fact that our work has been focused on migrations and bug fixes.
Our rolling velocity is &lt;strong>7.3&lt;/strong>, but that may be artificially inflated
by the high point total three iterations ago when we were closing out
the official charter period for the Geniza project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ppa">PPA&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve made substantial progress on the PPA migration, as evidenced by the
number of closed issues. We&amp;rsquo;ve figured out and resolved several problems,
so now it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of getting everything setup on the new production
server. We&amp;rsquo;re hopeful that we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to complete the migration this iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released a hotfix (version 4.10.1) because we discovered a high priority
bug that needed to be corrected quickly. The script that runs as a cron job to
export annotations and transcription content to GitHub for a versioned backup
was broken by a scenario we didn&amp;rsquo;t consider or encounter in testing: deleting
an annotation and then deleting (in this case via merge) the document it belonged to.
We were able to resolve this, along with a fix for a sorting regression in v4.10.
We&amp;rsquo;re continuing to make progress on the data export work for dataset publication,
and supporting the project under the CDH warranty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Oct 17 - Oct 28, 2022</title><link>/blog/2022/10/31/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/10/31/</guid><description>

&lt;p>This iteration marked the end of the charter for year 2 of the
CDH Research Partnership on Princeton Geniza Project (PGP). We released version
4.10 of PGP, with some bugfixes and small search and data improvements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re ramping up on other projects (PPA migration and the Lenape timetree),
but didn&amp;rsquo;t close any issues on those projects in the past iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our rolling development velocity is &lt;strong>15&lt;/strong> but only &lt;strong>3&lt;/strong> development points
for this iteration; we expect velocity to go down now that we&amp;rsquo;re not working on
the Geniza project.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Another high point iteration, as we made the final push to finish work
for the CDH/Geniza Research Partnership. For development, we closed &lt;strong>18 points&lt;/strong> across 31 issues, resulting in a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>18.67&lt;/strong> (&lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> the same as last iteration).
Design also had a big push, closing &lt;strong>14 points&lt;/strong> across 9 issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released v4.9 of Princeton Geniza Project mid-iteration. This was a major update
which included the long-awaited transcription migration from TEI to the new W3C
annotation format, and rolled out the new transcription editor tool, annotorious-tahqiq. This includes full functionality needed to add, edit, and delete transcriptions
with support for right-to-left text, as well as a new automated backup that
synchronizes transcription content to a GitHub repository, with co-author commits
to track contributions. As part of this release, we also loaded a number
of new images from Bodleian and JRL collections. After the release went out,
we started tackling bugs with the editor not found in testing and finishing
the remaining committed functionality for the CDH/PGP charter, prioritizing
search improvements for sunsetting PGPv3 and CSV exports for data publication,
with a smaller amount of effort going to localization functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lenape-timetree">Lenape Timetree&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We made significant progress on sitemap and wireframe designs for this project,
making a big push to get things ready for development while design is paused
for a month.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We had a massive iteration, as we make a push to complete the major remaining
deliverables on the Princeton Geniza Project before the partnership grant ends.
We also made some small progress on the Lenape timetree project. We completed
&lt;strong>48&lt;/strong> total points and closed &lt;strong>35&lt;/strong> issues for the Geniza project.
Looking just at development work, we &lt;strong>24&lt;/strong> development points across
the same number of issues, and our rolling development velocity is
at &lt;strong>18.7&lt;/strong>. For design, we closed an astounding &lt;strong>25&lt;/strong> points, all on Geniza.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-geniza-project">Princeton Geniza Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>On the development side, we&amp;rsquo;re making the last push to complete the steps needed to migrate the transcription content and launch the new transcription editor. This included a number of improvements to the editor, as well as the majority of the implementation of the functionality for backing up and versioning transcription content on GitHub. We fixed a bug in the Arabic to Judaeo-Arabic search syntax that was breaking exact phrase searching in Arabic. We also addressed several small accessibility problems that were flagged by the University&amp;rsquo;s new scanning tool, DubBot. For design, work completed
includes Arabic fonts and typography. Design work closed this iteration also includes a number of issues
related to site flow and preliminary designs for the cluster search,
which were designed in a previous iteration (before we decided to postpone that work),
and were reviewed and closed at the beginning of this iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We did not release a new version of the PGP site this iteration, but expect to release an update in the first half of this iteration and go live with the transcription migration and editor.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lenape-timetree">Lenape timetree&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed a task to improve the summary display of imported &amp;ldquo;leaf&amp;rdquo; data; the design work for sitemap and site flow was not yet being tracked in GitHub. Other improvements to the prototype site and design are ongoing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Sep 5 - Sep 16, 2022</title><link>/blog/2022/09/19/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/09/19/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Our primary focus continues to be Princeton Geniza Project, but we&amp;rsquo;re also
starting to track work on the Lenape Timetree project, and had a few releases
for other projects for maintenance and other updates. We closed &lt;strong>14&lt;/strong> development points and development velocity held nearly steady at &lt;strong>15&lt;/strong> points. We also closed a whopping &lt;strong>11&lt;/strong> design points across 8 issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-geniza-project">Princeton Geniza Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed work on a feature to allow admins to reorder images for a document, which was released in version 4.8; this caused a bug in editing documents without images, which necessitated a quick bugfix and releasing 4.8.1. We continued to make progress on the transcription migration &amp;amp; editor functionality. On the design side, we closed a number of issues related to the Hebrew version of the site.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lenape-princeton-timetree">Lenape Princeton Timetree&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We just started tracking work on this project in GitHub, which at this point consists of preliminary versions of a static site to work and a script to parse existing data,
as a way of prototyping and proposing a data model and site structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="other-releases">Other releases&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released a bugfix for the CDH website that was needed to help with freshening the site for thef all semester. We also released PPA version 3.8, with extended Gale/ECCO functionality.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We had another very productive iteration; we had &lt;strong>18&lt;/strong> points total accepted on the Princeton Geniza Project, and we completed &lt;strong>18&lt;/strong> development points. This results in a rolling development velocity of &lt;strong>15.7&lt;/strong> points, continuing our upward trend. We closed a total of 23 development issues, which includes a high number of chores and bugs; some of these were on other projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-geniza-project">Princeton Geniza Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The high number of points this iteration is largely due to significant progress on the transcription migration and new transcription editor functionality. We did also address some small bugs and other minor fixes; we did not release these changes to production during the iteration because we decided to prioritize other things, including making progress on the transcription editor.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cdh-website">CDH website&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We needed to update the CDH website so that Humanities + Data Science Institute instructors and participants could be included on our affiliates pages. We also corrected a few small bugs and accessibility problems in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ppa">PPA&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No development activity, but the remaining issues completed in the previous iteration were accepted. The completed work should be released and deployed early this iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sco">S&amp;amp;co&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We squeezed in two very minor updates to the Shakespeare and Company site; we hope these also will be released and deployed early this iteration.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We had a productive iteration, making good progress on both Princeton Geniza Project and Princeton Prosody Archive (PPA). We closed &lt;strong>13&lt;/strong> development points (18 issues); with three strong iterations in a row, we&amp;rsquo;re up to a rolling development velocity of &lt;strong>12&lt;/strong> points. We didn&amp;rsquo;t close design issues, but that&amp;rsquo;s because we have larger design tasks in progress.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released version 4.7, which includes some content editor improvements for tagging; improved display for non-document images in the image+transcription panel viewer for documents; the newly designed light/dark mode toggle was also implemented.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ppa">PPA&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed the remaining work on Gale/ECCO import and support that was leftover from last year&amp;rsquo;s enhancements, in particular: admin import for small batches,
excerpt support for Gale/ECCO works, and data improvements that were delayed pending API changes on Gale&amp;rsquo;s end. We started on functionality to group works into clusters to gather reprints and editions. We also did some other minor updates to improve performance, accessibility, and make the site more consistent.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="other">Other&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>updated the Startwords site with fixes for a couple of small display issues&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Belated iteration report, due to vacations last week. We closed a lot of development work (16 points, 23 issues); this is likely due to the transcription editor functionality that was tested and accepted and the number of small chores in the final push to get Startwords issue 3 out the door.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="startwords">Startwords&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We finally published &lt;a href="https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/issues/3/">Startwords issue 3&lt;/a>! GitHub issues completed in this iteration were chores related to getting the release out and quick bug fixes to address problems we discovered after the issue was published.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Version 4.6 went into production, with the new image + transcription viewer. We also tested closed a number of features related to the transcription editor.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ppa">PPA&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We started ramping back up on PPA development work this iteration, beginning with some python package updates and a few small chores.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we completed implementation of the MVP for the new image + transcription viewing panel on the document details page on the Princeton Geniza Project site. Specific features completed include image zoom controls (zoom is no longer enabled by default, which resolves some accessibility problems and avoids making the zoom a scroll trap) and switching between editions when a document has more than one transcription. We also completed work on a revised tag style, a change which was needed to properly handle accessibility checks and making sure that tags are always big enough tap targets. Although we completed the MVP functionality for the new viewer, we were delayed with releasing it to the production site due to a change in the interim transcription format and problems synchronizing transcriptions for documents with more than one edition, which requires data work to resolve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We completed 7 points of development work (10 issues) for a rolling velocity of 9.3; design work was impacted by staff unavailability.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration our primary focus was on Princeton Geniza Project, but we did close a few more issues related to the upcoming Startwords issue 3. Our development velocity is on an upward trend — we closed &lt;strong>21&lt;/strong> development points (16 issues), which gives us a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>13.7&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-geniza-project">Princeton Geniza Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This iteration we released version 4.5, which adds several features related to document date functionality: calendar conversion in admin for simple cases with Anno Mundi and Hijri calendars, improved date display on document details, and sorting and filtering search results by date. We also rolled out the new &amp;ldquo;related documents&amp;rdquo; page, improved image credits display for JTS content, and fixed a bug with handling Heidelberg IIIF. This update required a supporting release of &lt;code>djiffy&lt;/code>, to add support for displaying Creative Commons licenses in addition to rightstatements.org licenses. Several features for the new image+transcription panel viewer were tested but not released; they won&amp;rsquo;t go out until we have a full replacement for the current display, hopefully in the next release.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="startwords">Startwords&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We finished work on the new authors list page, adjusted the footer to add a link to the authors page, and completed a few other small style-related changes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We adjusted the schedule to make the past iteration a three-week iteration due to the Memorial holiday resulting in a very short week. Due to holidays, team member availability, and the chunks of work that are in progress, we didn&amp;rsquo;t publish any releases, but we did complete a lot of work. Our development velocity is up to &lt;strong>9.3&lt;/strong> points (14 points, 21 issues). We have the same exact velocity for design work (&lt;strong>9.3&lt;/strong>), with 12 points and 7 issues closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Major design work closed related to the new image and transcription panel, for which implementation are underway. We also completed designs for the related documents page. We also finished work on a number of features related to date filtering and historical calendar conversion, which we hope to make available in production soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="startwords">Startwords&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed much of the remaining work needed for issue 3, including: revised shadow text styles for the site homepage and single issue pages (pictured below), generalized the interlude styles invented for SW issue 1 so it can be used in any article in future; improved DOI display for translated articles; and fixed a couple of bugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cdh-ansible">cdh-ansible&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A small improvement in our project deploy scripts, suggested by PUL staff, resulted in a huge improvement in the time it takes to deploy projects, by configuring the deploy scripts to skip one-time setup tasks by default.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We released Geniza v4.4 early in this iteration to deliver work completed in the previous iteration, and then quickly discovered and fixed a bug with the menu button that made the site unnavigable on mobile. We did not get another release out during the iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We made progress on a number of design and development issues and both rolling velocity and iteration development work are at &lt;strong>6 points&lt;/strong>. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t reflect the large amount of in-progress work on transcription functionality (delivered for first-round testing but still very much in progress) and several related features around date/calendar conversion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="startwords">Startwords&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>No development work this iteration, but design work for issue 3 is nearly complete and editorial and design work will be ready soon for final handoff for development on the remaining items needed for completing this issue.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Apr 18 - Apr 29, 2022</title><link>/blog/2022/05/02/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/05/02/</guid><description>

&lt;p>This iteration we made progress on Geniza and closed out several issues for Startwords. We weren&amp;rsquo;t able to get a release out with the Geniza updates due to team commitments and availability at the end of the iteration, but we hope to get a release out early this iteration with the completed work. Our development velocity is fairly steady at &lt;strong>5&lt;/strong> points, but we closed &lt;strong>8&lt;/strong> development points and &lt;strong>17&lt;/strong> issues. We&amp;rsquo;re also continuing to make good progress with design work on both projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Notable work includes improvements to the public search — a filter for documents with images, options to sort by input date and shelfmark, and our first foray into Judaeo-Arabic conversion, making it possible to search on Judaeo-Arabic transcription content when inputting Arabic search terms. We updated the admin document view so that it uses the same image and transcription viewer as the public site, and improved the display and functionality in the IIIF image rights in that section. We also made progress on RTL design implementations, resolved a long-standing font loading issue in Percy, and finally set up Sphinx code documentation. We&amp;rsquo;re continuing to make progress on design and development for the new transcription functionality, although we have not yet been able to deliver it for testing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="startwords">Startwords&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We finalized designs for the new author list and linking to the author page in the footer, and completed testing on issues for reading articles and issues in translation and toggling between languages. We delivered a draft version of Issue 3 to the contributors with their revisions, so we are getting closer to publishing this issue.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we made progress on the remaining multilingual functionality and other features needed to publish &lt;em>Startwords&lt;/em> issue 3. We didn&amp;rsquo;t close a lot of points on the Geniza project because the major work going on at this point is prototyping and beginning to implement the new transcription functionality, and sketching out design ideas for the public display and interaction of images with transcription and translation content. Our rolling development velocity is &lt;strong>4.67&lt;/strong>, due to the low number of points completed in the last two iterations (3, 4). We expect this to pick up once we move out of the transcription prototyping phase and finish work on the Startwords issue.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we worked on needed functionality for &lt;em>Startwords&lt;/em> Issue 3, and made more progress prototyping and testing functionality for a transcription solution for the Geniza project. Because much of the development work consisted of chores, exploratory or prototyping, our iteration velocity and rolling velocity are both fairly low. We did make significant progress with Design work, both for Geniza and Startwords.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration our focus again was solely on the Geniza project. We put out a bug-fix release early in the iteration to address several highly noticeable problems that were identified by various members of the team, and then a feature release with new functionality, most notably implementing Turbo and Stimulus to make the document search more responsive and load changes more quickly. We also made some small changes to the document details page, including displaying primary and secondary languages, linking to other documents on the same fragments, and moving secondary metadata lower on the page.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our development rolling velocity is steady at &lt;strong>13 points&lt;/strong>, although this iteration we only closed &lt;strong>7&lt;/strong> story points. However, that&amp;rsquo;s in line with what we should expect, since it was effectively a half iteration in terms of developer staffing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we were primarily focused on Geniza, but did devote some efforts towards Startwords. Our development velocity has stabilized a bit: 13 points, 20 issues, for a rolling velocity of 13.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released another update (version 4.2) with more new features and improvements to the public site. The most visible change is the filter panel on the &lt;a href="https://geniza.princeton.edu/en/documents/">document search&lt;/a>, which now includes three new filters related to scholarship records. We&amp;rsquo;re also making progress on designs and backend support for the RTL versions of the site.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration our focus was entirely on the Princeton Geniza Project as we worked to address issues identified in the 4.0 release that we wanted to address before switching the site to the official &lt;a href="https://geniza.princeton.edu">https://geniza.princeton.edu&lt;/a> url (which we did on Thursday!).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Notable work completed in this iteration includes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>completion of design work on the new logo and logotype (shown below), which will be integrated into the site this week.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>search results now include image thumbnails when available&lt;/li>
&lt;li>an admin document merge function, so that duplicate documents and joins can be merged manually in the admin site instead of relying on spreadsheets and script to handle merging (we discovered the script method was error-prone since merging needs to be done carefully).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Our rolling velocity for development is &lt;strong>13&lt;/strong> points; this iteration we completed 19 points (16 issues).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At long last, we tagged and released the 4.0 version of Princeton Geniza Project! This is meets our agreement for a &amp;ldquo;Minimum Viable Product&amp;rdquo; to replace the current PGP v3.0. The new site isn&amp;rsquo;t publicly available just yet, but we&amp;rsquo;re planning to turn off IP access restriction by Thursday of this week at the latest and hoping to switch it to the official URL within another week.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We closed &lt;strong>24&lt;/strong> development issues this iteration, but only completed &lt;strong>8&lt;/strong> story points — likely because much of our focus was on finishing implementing visual designs, fixing bugs, and finishing chores in preparation for this release. Our rolling development velocity is 20 points, due to the huge iteration in December and the fact that we&amp;rsquo;re no longer counting the zero-point iteration around Thanksgiving.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mep-django releases were related to publication of the 1.2 version of the Shakespeare and Company Project datasets, which were published on Princeton&amp;rsquo;s DataSpace on January 31st.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Belated report on the first iteration of January 2022. This was effectively a long iteration, since it included work completed during the week of January 17th, which was a scheduled R&amp;amp;D week for CDH staff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our focus continues to be exclusively on Geniza, as we work closer and closer to completing the initial MVP that will be made public. We made tremendous progress on completing design work for site visuals, implementing the designs, finishing some of the final remaining functionality, and resolving a number of small bugs and chores that needed to be addressed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We closed 21 development issues, for a total of 11 story points and a rolling velocity of 17.3.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We extend this iteration to four weeks, which included the Christmas and New Year&amp;rsquo;s holidays
when most of the team was out. During this iteration, we published &lt;a href="https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/issues/2/">the second issue of &lt;em>Startwords&lt;/em>&lt;/a> and made significant progress on the Geniza 4.0 release. We have an enormous total of &lt;strong>41&lt;/strong> development story points closed this iteration and a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>18&lt;/strong> — this is due in part to the lengthened iteration, but also due to the significant push to complete the Geniza MVP and closing out a number of large issues (three 8-point development issues and two 5s!). We also have a huge total of &lt;strong>37&lt;/strong> points (16 issues) for design work, completing the majority of the design work for the Geniza MVP. The unevenness of the design velocity likely reflects Gissoo&amp;rsquo;s observation that visual design does not fit well with an Agile development workflow, since so many things need to be designed and reviewed together.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="startwords">Startwords&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed the remaining work to publish &lt;a href="https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/issues/2/">Startwords Issue 2&lt;/a>; work in this iteration included miscellaneous cleanup items for final publication of the essays in issue 2, and some minor cleanup work after the publication. We also started on prep work for functionality needed for issue 3, but none of those issues were closed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Although we postponed the 4.0 public MVP release until January, we did make a significant amount of progress towards completing the work targeted for that MVP, and we did release a 0.7 version with a significant number of updates since the previous release. Updates include improved citation formatting for footnotes and sources, revised scholarship record view for individual documents, an import of data from the PGP v3 links database (information now included in PGP v4 scholarship records), setting up Wagtail for management of content pages, and progress with interim transcription solution for synchronization from TEI to the database, including in search results, and displaying with or without images on document detail pages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also made tremendous progress on design: nearly all of the design work needed for the MVP has been completed and approved, and a significant amount of work was done towards implementing site visuals implement them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>New versions of djiffy and parasolr were released in support of the Geniza 0.7 release, with support for newer versions of Python &amp;amp; Django and improved functionality needed for the new Geniza search.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Nov 22 - Dec 3, 2021</title><link>/blog/2021/12/06/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/12/06/</guid><description>
&lt;p>We made progress on multiple projects, but didn&amp;rsquo;t close anything with points; this is due to the Thanksgiving holiday and the shift to working on Startwords to prep issue 2 for publication.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="startwords">Startwords&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed a number of updates in preparation for publishing Startwords issue 2, which looks to be in good shape to go out on time as planned.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The issues closed largely related to design and design implementation. We do have a large issue in-progress and nearly complete to update the scholarship details for individual documents; this issue was larger than expected due to the need to format references more like a citation, which involved some data model changes. Due to the holidays and rolling work on the MVP, we have not made any releases in a while to update production with the latest changes; we probably should do this sometime soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shakespeare-and-company-project">Shakespeare and Company Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released a micro update with maintenance updates, including python package upgrades and two minor adjustments in support of publishing new versions of the datasets. While we made the update, we added Zenode metadata and a citation file to make the GitHub repository more citable.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="archiving-derridas-margins">Archiving Derrida&amp;rsquo;s Margins&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This work is still not complete, but we made a small amount of progress on the final configuration needed for the archive site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Nov 8 - Nov 19, 2021</title><link>/blog/2021/11/22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/11/22/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Our rolling development velocity after this iteration is picking up (7.8) as geniza work gains momentum. For development work, we completed 21 issues and 13 points. We made what we hope to be the final Derrida release.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We made progress on the public document search, implementing styles and typography, and a preliminary implementation for synchronizing TEI transcriptions for search and display on the new site.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="derrida">derrida&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We developed a custom driver for browsertrix-crawler so that we could archive the historgram visualization pages and the deep-zoom image content on the site.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Oct 25 - Nov 5, 2021</title><link>/blog/2021/11/08/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/11/08/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Our rolling development velocity after this iteration is low (only &lt;strong>4 points&lt;/strong>), but we&amp;rsquo;re starting to gain momentum on the geniza development work and we&amp;rsquo;rec lose to wrapping up maintenance and chore work. For development work, we completed 17 issues and 9 points; we also made progress on geniza design work this iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re starting to make progress on the public site features planned for the first public release (PGP v4.0): adding functionality to the public document search, document details, implementing styles, and working to use localization and internationalization consistently. We&amp;rsquo;re also making progress on visual design and typography.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="derrida">derrida&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the work to archive Derrida&amp;rsquo;s Margins, we completed the remaining work to complete the web archiving (which included a custom web driver to capture the visualization and deep zoom images), and gathered needed information for customizing and configuring the deployed archive site.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="startwords">startwords&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Startwords is not scheduled for active development until next iteration, but as we identified and addressed one small item that was determined to be helpful for editing and publication prep; in this case, so the editors could give contributors a preview of how their revised essay might be presented on the site.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we closed 9 development issues but had zero points, because those issues were all chores and bugs. Our rolling velocity is &lt;strong>5.67&lt;/strong> but should pick up as we gain momentum on geniza work, especially since we&amp;rsquo;ve added contractor developers to help out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a &lt;strong>cdh web&lt;/strong> bugfix release that addressed two bugs, and a &lt;strong>derrida&lt;/strong> release with the code for the final data exports. We&amp;rsquo;re ramping up on &lt;strong>geniza&lt;/strong> work for the fall, which is reflected in the number of issues closed, including some frontend setup work, planning, and progress on design for content pages and document detail page.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We closed a rather small number of issues this iteration (5 development issues, 3 points) bringing our rolling velocity down a bit to &lt;strong>6.33&lt;/strong>. This is likely because our efforts were directed elsewhere; notably on completing the Geniza year 2 charter, which has now been finalized and signed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We made some progress closing out in-progress frontend development work on Geniza, finished the last set of updates on the Derrida data exports, and also released a bugfix for CDH web. (The bug is not listed below because it was reopened when we discovered the problem had only been partially solved.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration, we continued working on planned maintenance work and finishing the charter for the next year of work on the Geniza research partnership. Our rolling velocity is up to &lt;strong>7.7&lt;/strong>; points for this iteration were high because work included a large feature on the Geniza project that was finally completed and several features for Derrida data exports that had been in-progress for multiple iterations.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="derridas-margins">Derrida&amp;rsquo;s Margins&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed revisions on three of the four dataset exports, and corrected one bug in the previous version of the data exports and one bug in the IIIF image endpoint handling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We finally completed the script to merge documents, and fixed a bug that made it into production when part of the incompletely tested merge code was included in the last release. We also made progress on design work towards visual identity and color selection.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shakespeare-and-company">Shakespeare and Company&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We successsfully completed the migration to PUL infrastructure without hiccups, including switching the 100 years twitter bot cron job over to the new server. This update includes upgrades to python 3.6, Solr 8, and a switch from MySQL to Postgresql. Most crucially, this gets the code off of python 3.5 which has not been supported for nearly a year. Looking foward, we know have a path for testing and updating the application to newer versions of python, since the infrastructure on the PUL VMs is fully managed by our ansible deploy scripts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Aug 23 - Sep 3, 2021</title><link>/blog/2021/09/07/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2021/09/07/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Completed points for this iteration are quite low (only &lt;strong>2 points&lt;/strong>). This brings our rolling velocity down to &lt;strong>6&lt;/strong>, which is the lowest it&amp;rsquo;s been in quite some time. This is likely due to the focus on maintenance work and chartering the next year of the Princeton Geniza Project; we also have some in-progress work on revised data exports for Derrida&amp;rsquo;s Margins that have not been completed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cdh-web">CDH web&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released version 3.4 with the enhancements as planned in the charter, most notably a new site search. One new feature was completed this iteration, revising the home page to call attention to important information (about CDH and consults). We also fixed a small bug impacting the staff and executive committee pages.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released version 0.5 with high priority fixes and improvements that had been identified by the project team to help with ongoing data work. In progress work on a script to merge documents, which has been through multiple rounds of testing, was temporarily put in the ice box to prioritize work on the Geniza charter for the next year. We did also start work more seriously on frontend development and inftrastructure and visual design.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="derrida">Derrida&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Maintenance work is ongoing; we successfully set up continuous integration on GitHub Actions, to aid us in testing the remaining development (since Travis-CI is no longer reliable). We made progress on the data export scripts, but none of the issues were completed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shakespeare-and-company-project">Shakespeare and Company Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We made progress on maintenance work to migrate the application from the current host into PUL infrastructure, which includes a python version upgrade, new version of Solr, and switch from MySQL to Postgresql. The site is successfully running in the new QA environment, so after a bit more testing to confirm functionality and migrated data, we should be able to proceed and schedule a production migration.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration &lt;a href="https://cdh.princeton.edu/updates/2021/08/15/rebecca-munson/">we lost Rebecca Munson&lt;/a>, who was a long-time collaborator of the CDH Development &amp;amp; Design Team, project manager &amp;amp; project coordinator for many of our projects. In spite of that terrible loss, it&amp;rsquo;s good to do work, and we did make some progress on our planned work. Among other things, we implemented a special purple mode for the CDH website and released v3.3.1 so we could turn it on to honor her.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We completed &lt;strong>7&lt;/strong> development story points for a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>8.67&lt;/strong>; we also completed &lt;strong>14&lt;/strong> design story points, as all the design work for the CDH web v3.4 release was finalized.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cdh-web">CDH web&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The work for the 3.4 release is nearly done, and it should be completed and go into production soon. Completed work include designs for search, better visuals to highlight the about page and consultations on the home page, and the new site search.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We started up development on Geniza again, picking up some work that was left incomplete and small changes that will be helpful to the data team. Completed work includes capability to edit historic shelfmarks for Fragments, clean up of the India Book sources that were not grouped correctly on import, and a way to view actions on the admin site beyond the most recent ten or a specific document.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We had multiple projects active this iteration, roughly divided across developers on the team. The planned work for PPA spilled over and needed to be completed; work started on updates for CDH web identified in the recent project charter; and work continued on maintenance updates for Derrida&amp;rsquo;s Margins. We closed &lt;strong>24&lt;/strong> issues and a total of &lt;strong>9&lt;/strong> points for a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>11.3&lt;/strong>. The lower velocity reflects the kind of work we&amp;rsquo;re doing (including some maintenance), as well as other things going on, including the transition with some staff starting to work on campus again.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="project-specific-updates">Project-specific updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="ppa">PPA&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>This iteration we completed the work on 3.7 and released the new features to production. This update includes support for Gale/ECCO content as well as excerpt support for HathiTrust materials, which is a fairly major change to the collection. We&amp;rsquo;re looking forward to a write up from the team publicizing the changes and explaining what this means for PPA.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="cdhweb">CDHweb&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We released version 3.3 with support for oEmbed of Media Central videos, a new accessibility checker tool for content editors, and improved handling for moved and renamed pages. Implementation and design for the new site search is in progress, and has been successfully prototyped.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="derridas-margins">Derrida&amp;rsquo;s Margins&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We made progress on maintenance updates to Derrida&amp;rsquo;s Margins, including a bugfix release that corrects an image display problem that has been impacting the sites for several months. Work is underway to generate revised data exports and prep the site for archiving.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="shakespeare-and-company-project">Shakespeare and Company Project&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We completed work on two trivial changes and one data report to support data work for the next version of the data exports; the changes should go to production soon.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we made significant progress on PPA. All remaining planned work to support Gale/ECCO import and HathiTrust excerpts were moved to &amp;ldquo;development complete&amp;rdquo; status, but unfortunately testing issues related to indexing and keyword search were problematic and held up testing on a cluster of issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There was a smattering of progress on other projects as well. For the CDH website, we completed work to setup a new visual testing review workflow with &lt;a href="https://percy.io/">Percy&lt;/a>, which we hope will save time and improve our design implementation testing across projects. We continued to be paused on Geniza, but we had one issue closed that should have been accepted before, but was left open based on design feedback and changes requested rather than functionality. On Startwords, we also had a very minor style bugfix resolved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We extended this iteration for 3 weeks to account for vacation and the ACH2021 conference last week. We completed 10 development points, and have a rolling development velocity of 14.3 points.&lt;/p>

&lt;img src="/blog/2021/07/06/featured-cdhweb-embed_hu401108991c7d5a326e154ec8d24d8d4e_160474_640x0_resize_catmullrom_3.png" width="640" height="692"/>
&lt;p>This past iteration, we split our focus between PPA and CDH web. On PPA, we worked on adding support for importing Gale/ECCO content. For CDH web, we worked on the first charter for CDH web, to articulate the roles and responsibilities and prioritize for the next phases of work (chartering is not reflected in the GitHub issues reported here). We extended the iteration to three weeks, to work around an off week for June 28 — July 2 (CDH staff R&amp;amp;D week).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rolling velocity is 17 points, with 15 points accepted in this iteration and 28 issues closed. This is higher than we might expect, but due to the longer 3-week iteration and also a number of chores and duplicate issues that were cleaned up on GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ppa">PPA&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We made substantial progress on support for importing and searching across Gale/ECCO content alongside existing HathiTrust content. We also completed design work to update PPA display to handle multiple sources and different item types (excerpts and book sections).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cdh-web">CDH web&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We fixed a couple of small bugs, and adjusted the affiliates and students page so that the new Data Fellows would be included. We also ported a custom embed finder from the Shakespeare and Company codebase to allow embedding dynamic content in blog posts and other wagtail pages.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We fixed a few small bugs that were found in production after the release and data import, and also completed a few chores and small stories to help with data work in the new interface, including adding very simple date fields and a script to import Fragment image and IIIF urls from a CSV.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our focus this iteration was on Geniza work as we finished out the second phase of work and created our first production release: we successfully migrated the Princeton Geniza Project metadata from a Google Sheets spreadsheet into the new relational database!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Work leading up to the 0.3 release included further refinements to the editor/translator data import, various CSV exports for content editors and a feed to keep the current public PGP site up to date with changes made in the database. After the release, we did some follow up work to make some adjustments to the admin interface, address a couple of bugs found after the code went to production, and a very preliminary version of the public document search. Those updates have not yet been deployed, and another set of updates are still in progress or awaiting testing, so some wrap-up work will continue into the next iteration. As part of wrapping up this phase of work, we closed a number of experimental tasks on GitHub that are no longer relevant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The story points trend for the last two iterations (18 points each, rolling velocity of 15) shows the kind of momentum that is possible at this phase of a project, but also reflects the staffing adjustments we made to ensure we met our deadline to finish the metadata migration before the end of May.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we completed 18 development points on Geniza as we work towards a first release and migrating the metadata from the spreadsheet to the new relational database. We also completed a smattering of bugfixes and chores as part of planned maintenance work, and one unplanned bugfix. The 18 point total brings our rolling velocity up to 13.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-geniza-project">Princeton Geniza Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Notable development work completed this iteration are related to scholarship record data import and editing functionality, as well as handling demerge on import and improving the admin document search. For design, we made progress on content pages, updates to the auto-layout in Figma, and progress on typefaces, even though no design issues were closed this iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-prosody-archive">Princeton Prosody Archive&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Planned maintenance work on PPA included an update to switch out the frontend library Semantic UI, which is no longer being maintained, for the community fork, Fomantic UI. The other notable change is an improvement to hover and focus styles, for better accessibility and consistency.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cdh-website">CDH Website&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released minor update with a trivial bugfix to address something we missed in the 3.0 release, so that content editors can customize the preview text displayed for blog posts. We also closed a few more bug issues that are no longer relevant now that we&amp;rsquo;ve switched from Mezzanine to Wagtail.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we closed 10 development points for a rolling velocity of 8. Our primary focus was on Princeton Geniza Project, but we did a small amount of planned work on the CDH website, ansible deploy scripts, and a very small amount of unplanned work on Shakespeare and Company Project to fix a time-sensitive bug.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-geniza-project">Princeton Geniza Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Accepted development work consists of a preliminary document detail page for the public site and admin editing enhancements, including a footnote count for the source list in admin, a way to edit and link to documents on the fragment edit view, and a certainty flag for TextBlocks to handle potential joins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Completed design work includes a decision on document titles for detail pages as well as search and browse, revisions to the document detail page based on the initial implementation, and completed wireframes for sort and filter on search for all screens.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cdh-website">CDH Website&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed planned maintenance and released version 3.0.2 — this update removes all mezzanine dependencies and resets database migrations, making it possible for the site to finally be upgraded to newer versions of django and wagtail. This also resolved a bug in the 3.0 release.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shakespeare-and-company-project">Shakespeare and Company Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The bugfix release was a small change to address a limitation on the 100 years twitter code — it did not handle subscriptions and renewals with no known duration, as revealed by a tweet on Monday. The bugfix was out in time to handle the next occurrence on Friday.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we closed 11 development points for a rolling velocity of 19, still coming down from the massive number of points closed three iterations ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-geniza-project">Princeton Geniza Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We made more improvements to the data import, fixing Language+Script mapping based on the new display names and resolving all previously unhandled languages, and most notably parsing history input information (names and dates) into structured django log entries to preserve the known edit history of PGP documents. We also completed preliminary work on footnote models for linking scholarship records to documents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For design, wireframes for cluster view browse and search results pages for all screens (desktop, tablet, mobile) were all completed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cdh-website">CDH Website&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We fixed a couple more bugs in the 3.0 version and released a planned 3.0.1 cleanup release to remove exodus code specific to the shift to wagtail. This is a necessary step to removing mezzanine, which will finally let us upgrade to newer versions of Dljango and python.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The development points for this iteration were quite low (only 4 points), but our rolling velocity continues to be unnusually high (26 points) based on the last two iterations, which were included an enormous amount of work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on the design velocidy graph, we might be finding a new rhythm with design work on our new adjusted design schedule.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cdh-website">CDH Website&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We finally finished and deployed the 3.0 release, migrating content from the outdated and unsupported Mezzanine to Wagtail. This iteration included a few issues to close out the release, deploying the update and running the exodus script to convert content, and then some bugfixes and clean up work for a planned 3.0.1 release.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-geniza-project">Princeton Geniza Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This iteration we finished some smaller work related to the database and admin sorting, and made progress on document detail designs. Multiple larger features were delivered late in the iteration, which didn&amp;rsquo;t give enough time for testing to be completed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Low points this iteration may in part be a result of successful acceptance testing last iteration, which meant we had no in-progress work at the start of the iteration, as we&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past. Rolling velocity will smooth out the volatility here, as intended.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shakespeare-and-company">Shakespeare and Company&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We had a small release for S&amp;amp;co with one bug fix (tested last iteration) and an enhancement adapted from PPA, to support embedding dynamic content (such as the map below) in Analysis essays and other site content pages.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="demos">Demos&lt;/h2>

&lt;p>The points and total number of issues closed for the last iteration is quite high — 42 points total, 25 for cdhweb and 17 for geniza, which results in a rolling velocity of 27. I&amp;rsquo;d like to think this is a sign that we&amp;rsquo;re gaining momentum on geniza work, but suspect that the high numbers are due to work that rolled over from the last iteration and a significant push to finish cdhweb 3.0.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-geniza-project">Princeton Geniza Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re continuing to make progress on building out the database and importing existing data. New features include a document suppression feature, automatic tracking of historic shelfmarks, and a &amp;ldquo;needs review&amp;rdquo; field where content editors can add notes about problems or questions in the data that are used to create a queue of records with problems to be addressed. We also finished testing on data import issues from previous iterations, most notably preliminary document &amp;amp; fragment import.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cdh-website">CDH Website&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed features related to blog migration and managing site menus and navigation via wagtail, and resolved a number of longstanding bugs that are no longer an issue now that the site is on wagtail instead of mezzanine. There are only a few small issues rolling over for final testing and review before the 3.0 release can be created and deployed production.&lt;/p>
