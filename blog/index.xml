&lt;p>Last iteration we put a lot of time and effort into Startwords as we get close to our issue 1 deadline and launch date, although that&amp;rsquo;s not reflected in the number of tickets closed on GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re continuing to make progress on Geniza planning and prototyping. That isn&amp;rsquo;t particularly evident from the issues closed, but that&amp;rsquo;s in part because we were hung up on getting the hostname for the new test server and acceptance testing only started at the end of the iteration. Design work at this point is primarily research, which we have not been tracking on GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also made some minor improvements to our ansible deploys and dev/design site.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration marked our official start of work on the Geniza research partnership, now that the charter has been signed. We made progress on data modeling and a preliminary search prototype, but since none of those tasks have been completed they aren&amp;rsquo;t reflected in the issues and points below. We also saw a lot of activity on &lt;em>Startwords&lt;/em>, as the team makes the push to complete remaining functionality and styles needed for the project launch. We also made progress on PPA maintenance and bug fixes, although the fixes have not yet been released to production, and one bug fix is ready for testing but blocked waiting on HathiTrust restoring rsync dataset access.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration included work to complete cdh-web version 2.7, which consisted of maintenance upgrades and a few helpful features for fall; maintenance and bug fixes on PPA, including a refactor to use in-house Solr library parasolr, removing a dependency on a forked, unmaintained SolrClient; and continued progress on &lt;em>Startwords&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Major work not reflected here includes the final revisions on charter for the CDH/Geniza research partnership, which was signed and approved today, and improved planning and documentation for the steps to close out a project when a research partnership grant ends.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The last iteration we continued to spend time on project maintenance and updates. Closed issues on &lt;em>Startwords&lt;/em> and the pucas release are continuing and closing out work from the previous iterations. Active work this iteration that is incomplete and not reflected in the closed tickets include django/mezzanine upgrades for cdhweb, and refactoring PPA to remove an outdated SolrClient dependency and use parasolr instead. We also have now migrated our first repositories to use &lt;strong>main&lt;/strong> as the production branch name.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the last iteration we also wrote a new &lt;em>limited support agreement&lt;/em>, which was adapted and simplified from the &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3359203">&amp;ldquo;Built by CDH&amp;rdquo; Long Term Service Agreement&lt;/a> in order to offer minimal support for the &lt;a href="https://pemm.cdh.princeton.edu/">PEMM Incipit Search Tool&lt;/a> for a limited term (1 year, renewable for a second year). The limited support agreement for PEMM goes into effect today.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Not a lot of development work reported on GitHub because the primary team focus continues to be planning the new Research Partnership project. This iteration also included time spent on two internal project retrospectives (Shakespeare and Company Project, PEMM) and a CDH Retreat.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Active development work included progress on PPA bugfixes (delivered for testing but not complete) and minor maintenance updates to django-pucas (removing support for python 2.7 to fix the a failing master build, in preparation for migrating from master to main).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The long list of &amp;ldquo;wontfix&amp;rdquo; issues in the mep-django is a result of cleaning up GitHub for Shakespeare and Company Project to close issues that were postponed or wishlisted on the way to a 1.0 release and we no longer plan to work on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: August 10th, 2020</title><link>/blog/2020/08/august-10th-2020/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Aug 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/08/august-10th-2020/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Three week iteration due to multiple team member week-long vacations. Less development work than usual because the primary team focus has been on planning the new Research Partnership project.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Warranty Report: Shakespeare and Company Project</title><link>/blog/2020/07/warranty-report-shakespeare-and-company-project/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jul 2020 22:53:26 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/2020/07/warranty-report-shakespeare-and-company-project/</guid><description>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/">Shakespeare and Company Project&lt;/a> launched in May 2020 with a 1.0 release on May 14th, and had a planned 1.1 release on May 29th.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Lots of progress on &lt;em>Startwords&lt;/em>, but no official release until Issue 1 is ready.
PEMM release put off until this iteration since only one feature was completed.&lt;/p>
