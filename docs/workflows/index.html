This may take the form of a spreadsheet, or it may be an interface to a relational database.</p><h3 id=workflow-3>Workflow</h3><p>Any members of the project team who are working with the data (sometimes called “encoders”) use the project’s protocols to encode the data.</p><h3 id=best-practices-2>Best Practices</h3><p>The best practices for working with project data are codified as protocols and stored in the project’s Google Drive.</p><h2 id=development>Development</h2><h3 id=tools-5>Tools</h3><p>The project’s code is hosted on GitHub in a public repository under the <a href=https://github.com/princeton-cdh>Princeton-CDH organization</a>. GitHub offers a wide range of functionality related to the project’s code. The project also uses <a href=https://app.zenhub.com/>ZenHub</a>, which adds a layer of agile project management tooling on top of GitHub.</p><h3 id=workflow-4>Workflow</h3><p>The project team splits development up into two-week “iterations”; at the end of each iteration the completed features from that iteration are released and become public. Each iteration begins with a planning meeting of the dev & design team at which the team also reflects on the previous iteration.</p><p>Individual features and tasks are tracked using GitHub issues. Often, issues are written in the form of agile “user stories” - for example, “As a content editor, I want to select featured essays to show on the site home page so I can provide pathways into the content for non-academic users.” Some issues may not take the form of user stories - they may document bugs discovered in the project, or “chores” (one-off tasks that are necessary to support other work).</p><p>The dev & design team estimates the relative complexity of features in “points” to get a rough idea of how much work can be accomplished in a single iteration. GitHub does not natively provide features to track these points, so ZenHub is used to organize issues in terms of points and iterations.</p><p>ZenHub organizes dev and design issues using kanban-style boards; as issues are worked on they move through a pipeline of different stages from development to review to testing:</p><ul><li>an issue starts in the “icebox”, a place for work that isn’t ready to start yet</li><li>issues that are ready to be worked on in the current iteration are in the “backlog”</li><li>developers claim (assign) issues in the backlog and move them to “in progress”</li><li>when a feature’s code has been reviewed it goes to “development complete”</li><li>when a feature is ready to be tested it is delivered with notes and moved to “QA”</li><li>if the feature doesn’t pass testing it moves back to “in progress” for further work</li><li>if it does pass testing, it is closed and automatically moved to “completed”</li></ul><p>The Project Manager uses GitHub and ZenHub extensively to participate in testing of issues and to get a sense of what the dev & design team is actively working on and has completed. These tools offer a variety of reporting functions to get a better picture of how the team works together to author source code.</p><h2 id=ux-design>UX Design</h2><h3 id=tools-6>Tools</h3><p>CDH projects may use <a href=https://www.figma.com/>Figma</a> to create and store designs and possibly also <a href=https://zeplin.io/>Zeplin</a> for &ldquo;handing off&rdquo; designs to developers. Design tasks are tracked on GitHub/ZenHub as issues, in a similar manner to features in development.</p><h3 id=workflow-5>Workflow</h3><p>The UX Designer collaborates with the dev team in two-week “iterations”. At the end of each iteration, design tasks that are completed and have passed the review stage will be ready for implementation in the upcoming iteration. During iterations the UX Designer also focuses on designing/researching/testing for long-term design goals for the project (within the scope of the project grant cycle).</p><p>Design tasks are tracked using GitHub issues with the label “Design”. Often, design issues are written in the following form (focused on user goals and actions) - for example, “Design a way for the user to access all the essays that an issue contains so they can read them.” Other design issues include “Design chores”, which often entail updating the designs or some type of cleanup. Design chores are neither estimated nor reviewed.</p><p>Each design issue is estimated for its relative complexity in “points” to get a rough idea of how much work can be accomplished in a single iteration.</p><p>As design issues are worked on they move through a pipeline of different stages from design to review:</p><ul><li>a design issue starts in the “icebox”</li><li>issues that are ready to be worked on in the current iteration are in the “backlog”</li><li>once the UX Designer has started to work on an issue they move it from the backlog to “in progress”</li><li>when a feature is ready to be reviewed it is delivered with notes and moved to “QA”</li><li>if the design issue doesn’t pass the review the UX Designer works to identify and address what revisions it will need, - where it moves back to “in progress” for further work</li><li>if it does pass the review, it is closed and automatically moved to “completed”.</li></ul><div class="text-muted mt-5 pt-3 border-top">Last modified October 5, 2020: <a href=/commit/9b52ea4961363c37f12fac664e211da455653c23>Tweak iteration data file (9b52ea4)</a></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="bg-dark py-5 row d-print-none"><div class="container-fluid mx-sm-5"><div class=row><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-xs-center order-sm-2"></div><div class="col-6 col-sm-4 text-right text-xs-center order-sm-3"></div><div class="col-12 col-sm-4 text-center py-2 order-sm-2"></div></div></div></footer></div><script src=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.3/umd/popper.min.js integrity=sha384-ZMP7rVo3mIykV+2+9J3UJ46jBk0WLaUAdn689aCwoqbBJiSnjAK/l8WvCWPIPm49 crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/js/bootstrap.min.js integrity=sha384-ChfqqxuZUCnJSK3+MXmPNIyE6ZbWh2IMqE241rYiqJxyMiZ6OW/JmZQ5stwEULTy crossorigin=anonymous></script><script src=/js/main.min.70a7ced52ae72622da736444447707a25fdc16e0149c3ea32004ccbc519c39c1.js integrity="sha256-cKfO1SrnJiLac2RERHcHol/cFuAUnD6jIATMvFGcOcE=" crossorigin=anonymous></script></body></html>
