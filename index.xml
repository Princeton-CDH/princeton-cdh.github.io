&lt;p>This marked the second iteration of the new RSE team cycle, with a 8 day development sprint, followed by 2 days of R&amp;amp;D. The RSE team was focused on the PPA, as well as wrapping up some maintenance issues that carried over from last sprint.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="releases">Releases&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The team wrapped up two major releases this week. We started the iteration with the release of the Wagtail upgrade for CDH web ahead of the technical phase of the website redesign. And we closed the iteration with the release of version 1.6 and 1.6.1 of Shakespeare and Company, which closed out a cluster of issues around improving data imports and exports.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Springload redesign is moving forward with the implementation of the website redesign: &lt;a href="https://github.com/springload/cdh-web/">https://github.com/springload/cdh-web/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="ppa">PPA&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>For the main PPA application, the focus this iteration was on the integration with EEBO and addressing the shift in Gale&amp;rsquo;s approach to serving images. Both are underway and moving forward smoothly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the NLP project, worked continued on assessing and preparing the corpus for analysis, as well as initial planning for the creating of annotations. Laure completed the evaluation of the existing OCR, with a recommendation to re-OCR the text from Gale. The resulting data on detected languages also proved useful as a way to filter pages and to identify where the OCR error rate is likely high.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="aerial-archival-photography">Aerial Archival Photography&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We continue to make progress with assessing the work completed by Microsoft. We have a copy of the package developed for Prof. Kreike&amp;rsquo;s data. Next iteration we will have a call with the Microsoft to clarify any questions / procedures and attempt to run the package on Princeton hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="maintenace-projects">Maintenace Projects&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We continue to support and consult on the Geniza project, particularly around issues of search and solr.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bug with Ansible Tower was addressed by PUL, which clears the way to set up the deploy of our major web applications (CDH Web, Geniza, S&amp;amp;Co) through this interface. This will improve our workflow for collaborating with external partners and contractors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The issues with timeouts continues, and PUL has added datadog to the production applications so that we can get better visibility on what is happening.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And in preparation for next week, the VMs for the Derrida Archive are ready to go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the process front, we are working with GitHub Projects for managing each iteration and learning to use the built in charts, as well as how to export data from Projects. Jeri found a script for exporting a project board to a CSV, which we can use to capture our historical data (&lt;a href="https://github.com/fiedl/github-project-to-csv)">https://github.com/fiedl/github-project-to-csv)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="writing">Writing&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The long-awaited article-proofs arrived for the Shakespeare and Company cluster, which Rebecca was able to review, as well as finalize the corresponding replication code. In addition, she submitted the &amp;ldquo;Trust Your Code&amp;rdquo; article for publication; and submitted to the DH Mini Conference on Simulating Risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="upcoming-priorities">Upcoming Priorities&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Looking ahead, we will be focused next on completing the archive of Derrida&amp;rsquo;s Margins (ahead of the server being shut down), interfacing with Microsoft regarding their object detection pipeline, completing the itegration with EEBO data on PPA, and determining the work plan for identifying poems in the PPA data. We are also ramping up our preparations for the London RSE site visits and the DARIAH conference.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Early February was split between wrapping up existing projects, administrative tasks related to annual performance reviews and job descriptions, as well as progress on the current priorities of the PPA and the Kreike project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Shakespeare and Company / GeoTaste, the goal for this iteration was to complete dev work on the GeoTaste application and deploy to the Google Cloud sandbox, as well as finish the export and import commands. Both the import and export commands have open pull requests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Simulating Risk, Lara has requested some data analysis ahead of her talk on the 28th. There is an open pull request waiting for feedback from Lara and a meeting scheduled for the week of the 19th.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For Aerial CV, Jeri, Mary, and Laure met with Emmanuel, Wangyal, and Bill (the Time Traveling Trees Team) for a meet-and-greet, as well as early scoping meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For PPA, Mary completed acceptance testing on a number of cluster-bug related issues. We are also waiting on ProQuest for permission related to the content in EEBO.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="demos">Demos&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Potential in-meeting demos:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>import functionality on S&amp;amp;Co&lt;/li>
&lt;li>SimRisk data analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>Blog: Jan 22 - Feb 2, 2024</title><link>/blog/2024/02/05/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/02/05/</guid><description>
&lt;p>We made a lot of progress on a number of maintenance tasks this iteration, including some VM upgrades in collaboration with PUL and updating npm packages. We also fixed a glaring bug with image and style displays on the CDH website that was caused by the VM upgrade and the shift to having two machines for load-balancing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Simulating Risk, we completed work on a custom batch-runner for the hawk/dove multi risk attitude game to support large-scale data collection across a wide range of parameter combinations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The larger number of issues closed on the geniza github is due to the project team doing review to clean up and prioritize work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Jan 8 - Jan 19, 2024</title><link>/blog/2024/01/22/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2024/01/22/</guid><description>

&lt;p>This iteration, on the Simulating Risk project we completed review and acceptance testing of the last planned issues for refining the model to address known flaws and improve robustness, including an option to set initial risk attitudes based on different distributions (random, normal, skewed left or right, bimodal).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On PPA, we did a substantial amount of cleanup on GitHub in preparation for the upcoming work; we closed one chore completed in this iteration, and a few issues that we discovered have been resolved. We closed a large number of old issues (bugs and features both) that we&amp;rsquo;ve decided not to work on since they are not aligned with our priorities for the project. (These are tagged as &amp;ldquo;wontfix&amp;rdquo; and are not reflected in the totals for the iteration, since we did not work on them.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our rolling velocity is &lt;strong>4.3&lt;/strong>, which likely reflects somewhat slow progress on both development and testing due to holidays and other commitments in January, as well as the amount of time we&amp;rsquo;ve been spending on project planning and maintenance.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the last iteration of 2023, we made significant progress on multiple maintenance projects and completed a major feature on PPA looking towards research planned for 2024.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>PPA&lt;/strong>: We completed work on a new script to export a full-text corpus with page-level content corresponding to what&amp;rsquo;s available on the public site in Solr.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Shakespeare and Company Project&lt;/strong>: We released a new version of the django web application, which included important maintenance updates and some bug fixes.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>VM upgrades and load-balancing&lt;/strong>: We worked with PUL to upgrade VMs (from bionic to jammy) and load-balance several of our applications, in both QA/staging and Production environments. As part of this work, we closed out a number of issues related to our ansible deploys. The cdhweb micro release was also related to this upgrade.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Simulating Risk&lt;/strong>: We completed development on the remaining prioritized simulation updates to address flaws or add robustness checks, but due to the holidays they have not yet been reviewed and accepted.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The only tasks completed this iteration were a revision to the Simulating Risk hawk/dove game to add more options for neighborhood sizes, and a chore to improve the cdh-ansible repository based on feedback from PUL devops team members after a walkthrough of the codebase. The completed work is smaller due to staff time taken up by a conference and teaching. There is progress to update S&amp;amp;co dependencies (currently awaiting testing) and to implement a full-text corpus export script for PPA (in progress).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Nov 14 - Nov 25, 2023</title><link>/blog/2023/11/27/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/11/27/</guid><description>
&lt;p>We didn&amp;rsquo;t complete any new features this iteration due to other commitments and the holiday. The only issue closed during this was an ansible chore completed as part of the cdh-ansible overview with members of the PUL devops team. We are continuing work on PPA corpus generation, S&amp;amp;co maintenance, and simulations for Simulating Risk.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Oct 30 - Nov 10, 2023</title><link>/blog/2023/11/13/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/11/13/</guid><description>

&lt;p>As part of a deadline for demoing the Lenape Timetree project for the Munsee language symposium, we worked on some updates and bugfixes and released an update to the theme.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On Simulating Risk, we continued to refine the hawk/dove simulation and worked on batch run analysis. We also fixed a synchronicity bug identified by a philosopher that we consulted with and started working on adding more configurability to various neighborhoods, which will add more parameters for batch analysis.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We made progress on refining simulations for Simulating Risk; work included refactoring the code to split out single and variable risk modes, since the parameters were increasingly diverging, improving how the simulations and charts were running in Solara, and adding new charts the hawk/dove variable risk simulation to improve interpretation of the simulation&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we published Startwords issue 4, made progress on Simulating Risk hawk/dove simulation and a sandbox app. We also supported the work to upgrade the Geniza web application to Solr 9; this included releasing new versions of python libraries (piffle, parasolr) to support this update.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we closed out development on the GeoTaste MVP and finished preparations for publishing issue 4 of Startwords. The timetree project is no longer in active development, but as part of prepping for launch and handoff we split out the code and content into separate repositories and made the timetree theme installable as a Hugo module.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We worked across a number of different projects as we dealt with some maintenance upgrades,
regularly scheduled work, and some work on PPA that we bumped up in priority due to external deadlines. For development work, we completed &lt;strong>10&lt;/strong> points and closed 26 issues bringing up the rolling velocity slightly to &lt;strong>4.7&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We completed one more bugfix and released a minor update with some fixes and improvements tested the previous iteration. Visible updates include integration of a wagtail code formatting block and revised 404 and 500 error page images.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ppa">PPA&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>PPA was not originally on the schedule, but we bumped up priority on work that was planned for later this fall in order to generate PDFs of Editorial articles. We incorporated a few other small improvements into this update.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our work this iteration was spread across multiple project and included some on-going maintenance work, time-sensitive bug fixes, continuing effort on on-going research projects GeoTaste and Simulating Risk, and preliminary work for Startwords issue 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="project-updates">project updates&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="geotaste">GeoTaste&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Numerous issues closed as the project team makes a huge effort to close out the tool-building portion of the work and completed related data work needed for the application.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="simulating-risk">Simulating Risk&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We completed work on new Jupyter/Colab notebooks that allow running simulations interactively in Colab using Mesa&amp;rsquo;s new experimental &lt;code>JupyterViz&lt;/code> interface; because it&amp;rsquo;s experimental, this required some pull requests to update Mesa code to add support for functionality we were already using in the previous Mesa runserver interface.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ppa">PPA&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We preemptively scheduled editorial improvements that were scheduled for later work on PPA because we needed to generate PDFs of editorial essays that were needed for a promotion file.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="other">Other&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We also completed some ansible maintenance thanks to support from PUL, completed testing on some small updates for CDH web, made the Lenape Timetree codebase more citable, and closed out an old design task for Startwords in preparation for development work to support Startwords issue 4.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re a small team working on multiple projects at once. We made significant progress on the &lt;strong>geotaste&lt;/strong> tool, and work has ramped up in intensity with plans to complete the prototype by the end of August. We also continued making progress on the simulations for the &lt;strong>Simulating Risk&lt;/strong> project, completing a revision to one simulation and a new histogram chart. We also completed some maintenance work on the &lt;strong>CDH website&lt;/strong> to upgrade some dependencies, and released a micro version with those changes.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We extended this iteration to three weeks, to account for team members being away for the DH2023 conference and on vacation. Work in the past iteration included Simulating Risk, GeoTaste, and some maintenance. GeoTaste has been an ongoing project, but we are now starting to track work via GitHub issues and include it iteration reporting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In terms of development, we completed &lt;strong>8&lt;/strong> points and &lt;strong>14&lt;/strong> issues for a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>11.3&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s an open question how to track design moving forward, now that we no longer have a designer on staff and are working on projects with less dependency on design.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We made significant progress on the Lenape Timetree project as we worked
to close out the remaining in-scope features, addressed small bugs that cropped
up as the team worked on final edits, and prepped for a 1.0 release and
a soft launch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re starting to ramp up on the Simulating Risk project, and have started implementing
a first simulation, but haven&amp;rsquo;t yet closed any issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rolling development velocity is &lt;strong>11.33&lt;/strong>, based largely on the substantial amount of
work completed on the Lenape Timetree project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Work is on-going on the GeoTaste project, but we&amp;rsquo;re still considering how and if to include it in regular iteration reporting.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As in recent iterations, we again focused almost exclusively on the Lenape Timetree project, and made significant progress, including: finishing zoom functionality for mobile, drawing lines for the tree branches, adding a branch legend to the intro panel, and implementing content page and footer designs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For the second iteration in a row, we were able to focus all of our efforts on the Lenape Timetree project as we work to get it over the finish line, and we made significant progress, completing 27 points and 26 issues across design and development work. On the design side, we finished 18 points and 13 issues for a rolling velocity of 9.7; major efforts included the footer, work on visual identity, and 404 error page designs. On the development side, we closed 9 points and 13 issues, bringing our rolling velocity up to 4. The main functionality completed is a collection of user stories related to tag interactions within the timetree.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>All our effort went towards the Lenape Timetree project as we work to get it over the finish line. There isn&amp;rsquo;t as much visible progress in terms of closed issues as we might hope. Development velocity is &lt;strong>2.3&lt;/strong> with 2 points and 7 issues closed, and design velocity is &lt;strong>7.7&lt;/strong> with 2 issues closed. The development points are low in part to the number of design implementation, which we typically track as chores when they are not easily articulable as user-facing features. We have a large number of issues in progress, which hopefully we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to complete early this iteration and get a better estimate of how much work is left.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration we were able to focus entirely on the Lenape Timetree project. We continued with significant progress on the design work. On the implementation side, we made progress on network layout adjustments, a new visual debug mode to help understand and improve the layout, and some visual cleanup. Design rolling velocity is &lt;strong>11.7&lt;/strong>; development rolling velocity is &lt;strong>5.7&lt;/strong> but only 1 point and 3 development issues were closed, in part due to partial team stafing during the iteration.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this iteration, PPA 3.9 was released, which includes a major improvement to search functionality so that similar works or reprints are clustered by default (the relevant functionality was tested and accepted the previous iteration). On the Lenape Timetree project, major design issues were accomplished for tag and leaf interactions. We also completed the first-pass implementation on the active leaf styles, hover interactions for corresponding leaf and labels, and url behavior that makes it possible to bookmark the tree with a specific leaf showing. We also contributed to some small bugfixes and a major indexing speed improvement for the Geniza project — work that was previously left in-progress, and benefited from a recent discovery made while working on PPA that made it possible to optimize the database queries used for bulk indexing (indexing all Geniza documents went from somewhere around 20-30 minutes to ~2 minutes.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our rolling development velocity is stable, at &lt;strong>7 points&lt;/strong>, but this is due to the large number of points closed in the previous iteration when we completed the PPA search clustering functionality. We only completed &lt;strong>4 points&lt;/strong> of development work in the current iteration. The design velocity is on an upward trend, with two very productive iterations in a row, reflecting the substantial amount of design progress on the Lenape Timetree project in recent weeks.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At long last, we finally completed the PPA issues for clustering search results by default, after multiple rounds of testing, and addressing a few regressions introduced by the changes.
A new version of parasolr (0.9) has been released with the needed grouping functionality,
and we expect to release a new version of PPA with the functionality early this iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the Lenape Timetree project, we&amp;rsquo;ve made tremendous progress on design work for leaves in various states and other interactions, and saw some progress on improving the layout of the tree (multiline labels, adjusted leaf sizes, adjusted sizing for century bands.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of the large PPA work that was finally completed, we closed &lt;strong>12&lt;/strong> development points for a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>6.67&lt;/strong> — up significantly from preceding iterations, but probably higher than we expect going forward.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The only project with issues closed this iteration is the Lenape Princeton Timetree. We made progress on a number of design issues, and completed features to represent the data points as leaves and embed images in leaf details. There was some progress on
PPA to address issues found in testing, but the work was stalled with problems updating the staging site to deliver for retesting. Our rolling development velocity is &lt;strong>3.67&lt;/strong> and holding pretty steady for now around three points.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This iteration, we completed a lot of design and development work on Lenape. We also made progress on PPA, but there is a complicated group of related features that needs a few small changes after the most recent round of testing; we hope to complete those and deliver them to production in the coming iteration. The low development velocity (&lt;strong>3 points&lt;/strong>) is consistent over the last few weeks, but significantly impacted by the amount of team member time spent on teaching for Wintersession and H+DSI.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Tracking early January as a short iteration for reporting purposes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We made some progress on PPA and Lenape Timetree; we also completed some chores related to Ansible, including the replication playbook that has been in use in draft status for months and a task to update vault passwords due to the recent LastPass breach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also have work nearly complete enabling contractor deploy for Princeton Geniza Project. The issue is not tracked here because the pull request is still under review, but the new setup was used successfully for version 4.12 of Geniza listed below.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We fixed a couple of bugs on Princeton Geniza Project and tagged deployed a micro release to get the fixes into production. We also made some progress on the Lenape Timetree project. It isn&amp;rsquo;t reflected in the closed issues listed below, but we did make significant progress on PPA development work; we simply were not able to deliver for testing or close the issues.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The charts below show the substantial amount of effort dedicated to the Princeton Geniza Project in 2022, with a noticeable spike as we worked to complete our commitments on the project before the charter period ended in October.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s also noticeable activity on Startwords to finish publication on issue 3; work on PPA enhancements in August and November/December; and beginning to ramp up work on the Lenape Timetree project in the fall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The small amount of work spent on CDH web and mep-django (codebase for Shakepeare and Company Project) reflect a deliberate effort to minimize the work on those projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: What did we work on in 2021?</title><link>/blog/2023/01/what-did-we-work-on-in-2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/01/what-did-we-work-on-in-2021/</guid><description>
&lt;p>A belated look back at the work we did in 2021. The substantial effort on CDH web reflects the work to migrate to Wagtail for content management. We completed a substantial amount of work on the Princeton Geniza Project across the whole year, a set of enhancements for PPA in July, and a small amount of work on Startwords to publish issue 2. The work on the derrida-django codebase in the fall was to revise the published datasets and prep the side for archiving.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 2023 Q1 Schedule</title><link>/blog/2022/12/2023-q1-schedule/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/12/2023-q1-schedule/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Blog: Nov 28 - Dec 9, 2022</title><link>/blog/2022/12/12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/12/12/</guid><description>

&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s a busy time of year and we had a lot of other work going on in the past two that impacted what we were able to complete in terms of development and design work. For development, we closed 3 points and 13 issues for a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>5.3&lt;/strong> points. Design work is in progress, but none of it was completed since we&amp;rsquo;re still ramping back up on work that was paused.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lenape-timetree">Lenape timetree&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re finally starting to make more progress, including deciding who will review and sign off on development and design work for the project. We completed one story for the algorithmic layout of the leaves in the timetree, and completed some chores that will help set us up to work more efficiently moving forward (visual review with Percy, automated Lighthouse checks for accessibility, SEO, and page efficiency).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ppa">PPA&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Following up on our recent migration, we closed a number of chores and bugs (some of which were resolved by the migration). We didn&amp;rsquo;t complete the major next feature because other commitmennts didn&amp;rsquo;t give us enough time to follow up on tackling something so complex.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed a couple of bug fixes, two of which were introduced in the last release. Hopefully we can release a micro update with those bug fixes and get them out to production soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Note:&lt;/em> starting this iteration, we&amp;rsquo;re adding a new ignored tag, &lt;code>performant&lt;/code>. Issues with this label will be included in the list of closed issues but ignored when summarizing work completed and calculating velocity, since that work is being completed by a contractor and not done by this team.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We completed a couple of major things before the Thanksgiving holiday — completed the PPA migration to PUL infrastructure, and completed the dataset export work for PGP. We
completed &lt;strong>12&lt;/strong> development points for a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>5.33&lt;/strong> - the low velocity is due to the number of chores required to complete the PPA migration. We also finally completed the charter for the Lenape Timetree project, and will be circulating it to project stakeholders soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-prosody-archive">Princeton Prosody Archive&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We completed the last few steps for the migration, released version &lt;strong>3.8.1&lt;/strong> and switched the production site over so it is running on PUL infrastructure. We&amp;rsquo;ve already completed some initial upgrades (python version) that are easier to manage now, and are circling back to in-progress that wasn&amp;rsquo;t completed when PPA was in active development in August.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="princeton-geniza-project">Princeton Geniza Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released version &lt;strong>4.11&lt;/strong> with a few search improvements needed to decommission PGPv3 and completed work on dataset exports which will be the basis for published datasets from the project data. We also setup Zenodo sync for the codebase, registering a DOI and adding a citation file to make the code more citable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also have a large number of old issues that were closed thanks to some work from PGP project managers going through and reviewing — some of them have already been addressed, others are duplicates, and others are no longer priorities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The points completed in the last iteration are low due to staffing
and the fact that our work has been focused on migrations and bug fixes.
Our rolling velocity is &lt;strong>7.3&lt;/strong>, but that may be artificially inflated
by the high point total three iterations ago when we were closing out
the official charter period for the Geniza project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ppa">PPA&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve made substantial progress on the PPA migration, as evidenced by the
number of closed issues. We&amp;rsquo;ve figured out and resolved several problems,
so now it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of getting everything setup on the new production
server. We&amp;rsquo;re hopeful that we&amp;rsquo;ll be able to complete the migration this iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released a hotfix (version 4.10.1) because we discovered a high priority
bug that needed to be corrected quickly. The script that runs as a cron job to
export annotations and transcription content to GitHub for a versioned backup
was broken by a scenario we didn&amp;rsquo;t consider or encounter in testing: deleting
an annotation and then deleting (in this case via merge) the document it belonged to.
We were able to resolve this, along with a fix for a sorting regression in v4.10.
We&amp;rsquo;re continuing to make progress on the data export work for dataset publication,
and supporting the project under the CDH warranty.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Oct 17 - Oct 28, 2022</title><link>/blog/2022/10/31/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/10/31/</guid><description>

&lt;p>This iteration marked the end of the charter for year 2 of the
CDH Research Partnership on Princeton Geniza Project (PGP). We released version
4.10 of PGP, with some bugfixes and small search and data improvements.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re ramping up on other projects (PPA migration and the Lenape timetree),
but didn&amp;rsquo;t close any issues on those projects in the past iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our rolling development velocity is &lt;strong>15&lt;/strong> but only &lt;strong>3&lt;/strong> development points
for this iteration; we expect velocity to go down now that we&amp;rsquo;re not working on
the Geniza project.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Another high point iteration, as we made the final push to finish work
for the CDH/Geniza Research Partnership. For development, we closed &lt;strong>18 points&lt;/strong> across 31 issues, resulting in a rolling velocity of &lt;strong>18.67&lt;/strong> (&lt;em>exactly&lt;/em> the same as last iteration).
Design also had a big push, closing &lt;strong>14 points&lt;/strong> across 9 issues.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="geniza">Geniza&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We released v4.9 of Princeton Geniza Project mid-iteration. This was a major update
which included the long-awaited transcription migration from TEI to the new W3C
annotation format, and rolled out the new transcription editor tool, annotorious-tahqiq. This includes full functionality needed to add, edit, and delete transcriptions
with support for right-to-left text, as well as a new automated backup that
synchronizes transcription content to a GitHub repository, with co-author commits
to track contributions. As part of this release, we also loaded a number
of new images from Bodleian and JRL collections. After the release went out,
we started tackling bugs with the editor not found in testing and finishing
the remaining committed functionality for the CDH/PGP charter, prioritizing
search improvements for sunsetting PGPv3 and CSV exports for data publication,
with a smaller amount of effort going to localization functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lenape-timetree">Lenape Timetree&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We made significant progress on sitemap and wireframe designs for this project,
making a big push to get things ready for development while design is paused
for a month.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We had a massive iteration, as we make a push to complete the major remaining
deliverables on the Princeton Geniza Project before the partnership grant ends.
We also made some small progress on the Lenape timetree project. We completed
&lt;strong>48&lt;/strong> total points and closed &lt;strong>35&lt;/strong> issues for the Geniza project.
Looking just at development work, we &lt;strong>24&lt;/strong> development points across
the same number of issues, and our rolling development velocity is
at &lt;strong>18.7&lt;/strong>. For design, we closed an astounding &lt;strong>25&lt;/strong> points, all on Geniza.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>On the development side, we&amp;rsquo;re making the last push to complete the steps needed to migrate the transcription content and launch the new transcription editor. This included a number of improvements to the editor, as well as the majority of the implementation of the functionality for backing up and versioning transcription content on GitHub. We fixed a bug in the Arabic to Judaeo-Arabic search syntax that was breaking exact phrase searching in Arabic. We also addressed several small accessibility problems that were flagged by the University&amp;rsquo;s new scanning tool, DubBot. For design, work completed
includes Arabic fonts and typography. Design work closed this iteration also includes a number of issues
related to site flow and preliminary designs for the cluster search,
which were designed in a previous iteration (before we decided to postpone that work),
and were reviewed and closed at the beginning of this iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We did not release a new version of the PGP site this iteration, but expect to release an update in the first half of this iteration and go live with the transcription migration and editor.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We completed a task to improve the summary display of imported &amp;ldquo;leaf&amp;rdquo; data; the design work for sitemap and site flow was not yet being tracked in GitHub. Other improvements to the prototype site and design are ongoing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: 2022 Q4 Schedule</title><link>/blog/2022/09/2022-q4-schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2022/09/2022-q4-schedule/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
