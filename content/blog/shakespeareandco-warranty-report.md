The [Shakespeare and Company Project](https://shakespeareandco.princeton.edu/) launched in May 2020 with a 1.0 release on May 14th, and had a planned 1.1 release on May 29th.

The warranty period began on June 2nd, 2020 and ended August 2nd.

Releases included work needed for updates to the data export logic for the 1.0 data release,
and code added by Rebecca Koeser (taken on as R&D work) to automate the 100 years ago today twitter account.
