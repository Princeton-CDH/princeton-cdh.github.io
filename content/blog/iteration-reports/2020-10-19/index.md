Last iteration we put a lot of time and effort into Startwords as we get close to our issue 1 deadline and launch date, although that's not reflected in the number of tickets closed on GitHub.

We're continuing to make progress on Geniza planning and prototyping. That isn't particularly evident from the issues closed, but that's in part because we were hung up on getting the hostname for the new test server and acceptance testing only started at the end of the iteration.  Design work at this point is primarily research, which we have not been tracking on GitHub.

We also made some minor improvements to our ansible deploys and dev/design site.
