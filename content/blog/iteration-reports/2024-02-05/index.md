We made a lot of progress on a number of maintenance tasks this iteration, including some VM upgrades in collaboration with PUL and updating npm packages. We also fixed a glaring bug with image and style displays on the CDH website that was caused by the VM upgrade and the shift to having two machines for load-balancing.

On Simulating Risk, we completed work on a custom batch-runner for the hawk/dove multi risk attitude game to support large-scale data collection across a wide range of parameter combinations. 

The larger number of issues closed on the geniza github is due to the project team doing review to clean up and prioritize work.
