This iteration we made significant progress on PPA. All remaining planned work to support Gale/ECCO import and HathiTrust excerpts were moved to "development complete" status, but unfortunately testing issues related to indexing and keyword search were problematic and held up testing on a cluster of issues.

There was a smattering of progress on other projects as well. For the CDH website, we completed work to setup a new visual testing review workflow with [Percy](https://percy.io/), which we hope will save time and improve our design implementation testing across projects.  We continued to be paused on Geniza, but we had one issue closed that should have been accepted before, but was left open based on design feedback and changes requested rather than functionality. On Startwords, we also had a very minor style bugfix resolved.

We extended this iteration for 3 weeks to account for vacation and the ACH2021 conference last week. We completed 10 development points, and have a rolling development velocity of 14.3 points.
