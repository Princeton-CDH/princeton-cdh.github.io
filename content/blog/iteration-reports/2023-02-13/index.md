The only project with issues closed this iteration is the Lenape Princeton Timetree. We made progress on a number of design issues, and completed features to represent the data points as leaves and embed images in leaf details. There was some progress on 
PPA to address issues found in testing, but the work was stalled with problems updating the staging site to deliver for retesting.

## Demos
