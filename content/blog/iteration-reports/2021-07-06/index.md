This past iteration, we split our focus between PPA and CDH web. On PPA, we worked on adding support for importing Gale/ECCO content. For CDH web, we worked on the first charter for CDH web, to articulate the roles and responsibilities and prioritize for the next  phases of work (chartering is not reflected in the GitHub issues reported here).  We extended the iteration to three weeks, to work around an off week for June 28 — July 2 (CDH staff R&D week).

Rolling velocity is 17 points, with 15 points accepted in this iteration and 28 issues closed. This is higher than we might expect, but due to the longer 3-week iteration and also a number of chores and duplicate issues that were cleaned up on GitHub.

## PPA

We made substantial progress on support for importing and searching across Gale/ECCO content alongside existing HathiTrust content. We also completed design work to update PPA  display to handle multiple sources and different item types (excerpts and book sections).

## CDH web

We fixed a couple of small bugs, and adjusted the affiliates and students page so that the new Data Fellows would be included. We also ported a custom embed finder from the Shakespeare and Company codebase to allow embedding dynamic content in blog posts and other wagtail pages.

## Geniza

We fixed a few small bugs that were found in production after the release and data import, and also completed a few chores and small stories to help with data work in the new interface, including adding very simple date fields and a script to import Fragment image and IIIF urls from a CSV.

## Demos
