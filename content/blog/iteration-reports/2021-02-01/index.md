Last iteration we made substantial progress on the cdhweb "exodus" from mezzanine to wagtail: features related to editing and "exodizing" content pages and uploaded images have been tested and accepted, and more work is underway. 

Active development was paused on Geniza, but design work continued on a revised sitemap / site flow diagram for the new PGP site and reports to share information from usability testing.

Development work on Shakespeare and Company Project was to support updated data exports; version 1.1 of the datasets were published January 29th. The parasolr hotfix was due to a problem identified in prepping the Shakespeare and Company Project release.

We also deployed version 3.5 of PPA to production at the beginning of this iteration (the release updates and prep were completed before the holidays), which enabled the team to finally add new content from HathiTrust.
