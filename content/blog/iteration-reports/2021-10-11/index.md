We closed a rather small number of issues this iteration (5 development issues, 3 points) bringing our rolling velocity down a bit to **6.33**. This is likely because our efforts were directed elsewhere; notably on completing the Geniza year 2 charter, which has now been finalized and signed.

We made some progress closing out in-progress frontend development work on Geniza, finished the last set of updates on the Derrida data exports, and also released a bugfix for CDH web. (The bug is not listed below because it was reopened when we discovered the problem had only been partially solved.)
