This iteration we paused active software development on the Geniza project, although design research and work on sitemap and continued, along with planning for the next phase.

We shifted development efforts to an infrastructure migration for the CDH website and planning for CDH web 3.0, which consists of a major migration to move content management functionality from Mezzanine to Wagtail.

There was also development effort on Shakespeare and Company Project with the main goal of generating updated dataset exports in January, although we did address a handful of small bugs.

This iteration we also had PPA work become unblocked: the revised solution for adding new content from HathiTrust was blocked by errors with rsync, which were finally resolved this iteration, so the feature was finally delivered for testing.

Because the work this iteration was largely focused on infrastructure and data, there is nothing visual to demo. The high number of development issues closed relative to points reflects the number of bugs and chores closed, and also reflects the fact that much of the work for CDH web remains in-progress.
