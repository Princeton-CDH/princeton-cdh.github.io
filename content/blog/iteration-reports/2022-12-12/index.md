It's a busy time of year and we had a lot of other work going on in the past two that impacted what we were able to complete in terms of development and design work. For development, we closed 3 points and 13 issues for a rolling velocity of **5.3** points. Design work is in progress, but none of it was completed since we're still ramping back up on work that was paused.

## Lenape timetree

We're finally starting to make more progress, including deciding who will review and sign off on development and design work for the project. We completed one story for the algorithmic layout of the leaves in the timetree, and completed some chores that will help set us up to work more efficiently moving forward (visual review with Percy, automated Lighthouse checks for accessibility, SEO, and page efficiency).

## PPA

Following up on our recent migration, we closed a number of chores and bugs (some of which were resolved by the migration). We didn't complete the major next feature because other commitmennts didn't give us enough time to follow up on tackling something so complex.

## Geniza

We completed a couple of bug fixes, two of which were introduced in the last release. Hopefully we can release a micro update with those bug fixes and get them out to production soon. 

*Note:* starting this iteration, we're adding a new ignored tag, `performant`. Issues with this label will be included in the list of closed issues but ignored when summarizing work completed and calculating velocity, since that work is being completed by a contractor and not done by this team.
