We had multiple projects active this iteration, roughly divided across developers on the team. The planned work for PPA spilled over and needed to be completed; work started on updates for CDH web identified in the recent project charter; and work continued on maintenance updates for Derrida's Margins.  We closed **24** issues and a total of **9** points for a rolling velocity of **11.3**. The lower velocity reflects the kind of work we're doing (including some maintenance), as well as other things going on, including the transition with some staff starting to work on campus again.

## Project-specific updates

### PPA

This iteration we completed the work on 3.7 and released the new features to production. This update includes support for Gale/ECCO content as well as excerpt support for HathiTrust materials, which is a fairly major change to the collection. We're looking forward to a write up from the team publicizing the changes and explaining what this means for PPA.

### CDHweb

We released version 3.3 with support for oEmbed of Media Central videos, a new accessibility checker tool for content editors, and improved handling for moved and renamed pages.  Implementation and design for the new site search is in progress, and has been successfully prototyped.

### Derrida's Margins

We made progress on maintenance updates to Derrida's Margins, including a bugfix release that corrects an image display problem that has been impacting the sites for several months. Work is underway to generate revised data exports and prep the site for archiving.

### Shakespeare and Company Project

We completed work on two trivial changes and one data report to support data work for the next version of the data exports; the changes should go to production soon.
