We fixed a couple of bugs on Princeton Geniza Project and tagged deployed a micro release to get the fixes into production. We also made some progress on the Lenape Timetree project. It isn't reflected in the closed issues listed below, but we did make significant progress on PPA development work; we simply were not able to deliver for testing or close the issues.

## Demos
