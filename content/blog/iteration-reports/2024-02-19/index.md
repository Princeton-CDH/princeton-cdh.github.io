Early February was split between wrapping up existing projects, administrative tasks related to annual performance reviews and job descriptions, as well as progress on the current priorities of the PPA and the Kreike project.

For Shakespeare and Company / GeoTaste, the goal for this iteration was to complete dev work on the GeoTaste application and deploy to the Google Cloud sandbox, as well as finish the export and import commands. Both the import and export commands have open pull requests.

For Simulating Risk, Lara has requested some data analysis ahead of her talk on the 28th. There is an open pull request waiting for feedback from Lara and a meeting scheduled for the week of the 19th. 

For Aerial CV, Jeri, Mary, and Laure met with Emmanuel, Wangyal, and Bill (the Time Traveling Trees Team) for a meet-and-greet, as well as early scoping meeting. 

For PPA, Mary completed acceptance testing on a number of cluster-bug related issues. We are also waiting on ProQuest for permission related to the content in EEBO.
