This iteration marked the end of the charter for year 2 of the
CDH Research Partnership on Princeton Geniza Project (PGP). We released version 
4.10 of PGP, with some bugfixes and small search and data improvements.

We're ramping up on other projects (PPA migration and the Lenape timetree), 
but didn't close any issues on those projects in the past iteration. 

Our rolling development velocity is **15** but only **3** development points 
for this iteration; we expect velocity to go down now that we're not working on
the Geniza project.
