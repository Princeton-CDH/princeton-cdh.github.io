In this iteration, PPA 3.9 was released, which contains a major improvement to search functionality regarding clusters of works. In Lenape, major design issues were accomplished for tag and leaf interactions. RSK implemented a first pass of active leaf styles and interaction with panels. Ryan also caught up with GeoTaste work.
