The last iteration we continued to spend time on project maintenance and updates. Closed issues on *Startwords* and the pucas release are continuing and closing out work from the previous iterations.  Active work this iteration that is incomplete and not reflected in the closed tickets include django/mezzanine upgrades for cdhweb, and refactoring PPA to remove an outdated SolrClient dependency and use parasolr instead. We also have now migrated our first repositories to use **main** as the production branch name.
