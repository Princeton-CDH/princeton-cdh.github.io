Very pleased to report that this past iteration we finally published [Issue One of _Startwords_](https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/issues/1/). The velocity charts below reflect the effort to get this out the door, including completion of design and implementation on an experimental piece and a large amount of work to finish converting the long "Data Beyond Vision" essay and related snippets to markdown, and to finish custom styles for the essay, including PDF styles.

We also continuing our work on prototyping and data exploration for the Geniza project; this iteration saw our first two search prototype stories accepted. 

We're also continuing to make progress switching our GitHub repositories to a default branch of **main**. In the last iteration, we updated the Ansible deploys to use **main** by default for production deploys, and updated all projects with a production deploy.
