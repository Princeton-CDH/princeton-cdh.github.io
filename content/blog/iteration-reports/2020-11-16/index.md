This iteration we made substantial progress on our Geniza search prototyping, most notably implementing the first two steps towards a prototype of the holistic search interface that Gissoo has been designing.

We also made some updates and fixed some bugs for CDH web, towards a maintenance release that will go out early this iteration.
