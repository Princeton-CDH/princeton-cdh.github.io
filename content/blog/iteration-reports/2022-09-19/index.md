Our primary focus continues to be Princeton Geniza Project, but we're also
starting to track work on the Lenape Timetree project, and had a few releases 
for other projects for maintenance and other updates. We closed **14** development points and development velocity held nearly steady at **15** points. We also closed a whopping **11** design points across 8 issues.

## Princeton Geniza Project

We completed work on a feature to allow admins to reorder images for a document, which was released in version 4.8; this caused a bug in editing documents without images, which necessitated a quick bugfix and releasing 4.8.1. We continued to make progress on the transcription migration & editor functionality. On the design side, we closed a number of issues related to the Hebrew version of the site.

## Lenape Princeton Timetree

We just started tracking work on this project in GitHub, which at this point consists of preliminary versions of a static site to work and a script to parse existing data,
as a way of prototyping and proposing a data model and site structure.

## Other releases

We released a bugfix for the CDH website that was needed to help with freshening the site for thef all semester. We also released PPA version 3.8, with extended Gale/ECCO functionality.
