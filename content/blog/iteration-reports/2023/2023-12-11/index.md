The only tasks completed this iteration were a revision to the Simulating Risk hawk/dove game to add more options for neighborhood sizes, and a chore to improve the cdh-ansible repository based on feedback from PUL devops team members after a walkthrough of the codebase. The completed work is smaller due to staff time taken up by a conference and teaching. There is progress to update S&co dependencies (currently awaiting testing) and to implement a full-text corpus export script for PPA (in progress).
