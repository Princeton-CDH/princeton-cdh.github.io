We made progress on refining simulations for Simulating Risk; work included refactoring the code to split out single and variable risk modes, since the parameters were increasingly diverging, improving how the simulations and charts were running in Solara, and adding new charts the hawk/dove variable risk simulation to improve interpretation of the simulation

## Demos
