We worked across a number of different projects as we dealt with some maintenance upgrades,
regularly scheduled work, and some work on PPA that we bumped up in priority due to external deadlines.  For development work, we completed **10** points and closed 26 issues bringing up the rolling velocity slightly to **4.7**.

## GeoTaste

Continued progress towards closing out the prototype.

## Simulating Risk

Completed the initial version of the new Hawk/Dove interactive game, with configurable initial hawk odds parameter. 

## Startwords

Prepping for publication of issue 4. We implemented the new CJK typeface needed for this issue, and completed work on some of the figures and several small issues that cropped up as we worked on this issue.

## CDH web

We completed one more bugfix and released a minor update with some fixes and improvements tested the previous iteration. Visible updates include integration of a wagtail code formatting block and revised 404 and 500 error page images.

## PPA

PPA was not originally on the schedule, but we bumped up priority on work that was planned for later this fall in order to generate PDFs of Editorial articles. We incorporated a few other small improvements into this update.
