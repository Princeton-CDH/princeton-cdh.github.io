Our work this iteration was spread across multiple project and included some on-going maintenance work, time-sensitive bug fixes, continuing effort on on-going research projects GeoTaste and Simulating Risk, and preliminary work for Startwords issue 4.

## project updates

### GeoTaste

Numerous issues closed as the project team makes a huge effort to close out the tool-building portion of the work and completed related data work needed for the application.

### Simulating Risk

We completed work on new Jupyter/Colab notebooks that allow running simulations interactively in Colab using Mesa's new experimental `JupyterViz` interface; because it's experimental, this required some pull requests to update Mesa code to add support for functionality we were already using in the previous Mesa runserver interface.

### PPA

We preemptively scheduled editorial improvements that were scheduled for later work on PPA because we needed to generate PDFs of editorial essays that were needed for a promotion file.

### Other

We also completed some ansible maintenance thanks to support from PUL, completed testing on some small updates for CDH web, made the Lenape Timetree codebase more citable, and closed out an old design task for Startwords in preparation for development work to support Startwords issue 4.
