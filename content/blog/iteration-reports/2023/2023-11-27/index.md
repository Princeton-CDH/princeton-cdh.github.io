We didn't complete any new features this iteration due to other commitments and the holiday. The only issue closed during this was an ansible chore completed as part of the cdh-ansible overview with members of the PUL devops team. We are continuing work on PPA corpus generation, S&co maintenance, and simulations for Simulating Risk.
