This iteration we were able to focus entirely on the Lenape Timetree project. We continued with significant progress on the design work. On the implementation side, we made progress on network layout adjustments, a new visual debug mode to help understand and improve the layout, and some visual cleanup. Design rolling velocity is **11.7**; development rolling velocity is **5.7** but only 1 point and 3 development issues were closed, in part due to partial team stafing during the iteration.
