All our effort went towards the Lenape Timetree project as we work to get it over the finish line. There isn't as much visible progress in terms of closed issues as we might hope. Development velocity is **2.3** with 2 points and 7 issues closed, and design velocity is **7.7** with 2 issues closed. The development points are low in part to the number of design implementation, which we typically track as chores when they are not easily articulable as user-facing features. We have a large number of issues in progress, which hopefully we'll be able to complete early this iteration and get a better estimate of how much work is left.
