This iteration we published Startwords issue 4, made progress on Simulating Risk hawk/dove simulation and a sandbox app. We also supported the work to upgrade the Geniza web application to Solr 9; this included releasing new versions of python libraries (piffle, parasolr) to support this update.

## Demos
