We extended this iteration to three weeks, to account for team members being away for the DH2023 conference and on vacation.  Work in the past iteration included Simulating Risk, GeoTaste, and some maintenance. GeoTaste has been an ongoing project, but we are now starting to track work via GitHub issues and include it iteration reporting.

In terms of development, we completed **8** points and **14** issues for a rolling velocity of **11.3**.

It's an open question how to track design moving forward, now that we no longer have a designer on staff and are working on projects with less dependency on design.
