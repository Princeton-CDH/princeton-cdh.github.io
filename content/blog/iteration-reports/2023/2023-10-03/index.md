This iteration we closed out development on the GeoTaste MVP and finished preparations for publishing issue 4 of Startwords. The timetree project is no longer in active development, but as part of prepping for launch and handoff we split out the code and content into separate repositories and made the timetree theme installable as a Hugo module.


## Demos
* [Startwords issue 4](https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/issues/4/)
