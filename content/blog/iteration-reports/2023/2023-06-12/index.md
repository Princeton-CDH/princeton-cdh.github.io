We made significant progress on the Lenape Timetree project as we worked
to close out the remaining in-scope features, addressed small bugs that cropped
up as the team worked on final edits, and prepped for a 1.0 release and 
a soft launch.

We're starting to ramp up on the Simulating Risk project, and have started implementing
a first simulation, but haven't yet closed any issues.

Rolling development velocity is **11.33**, based largely on the substantial amount of
work completed on the Lenape Timetree project.

Work is on-going on the GeoTaste project, but we're still considering how and if to include it in regular iteration reporting.
