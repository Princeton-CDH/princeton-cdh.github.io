Tracking early January as a short iteration for reporting purposes.

We made some progress on PPA and Lenape Timetree; we also completed some chores related to Ansible, including the replication playbook that has been in use in draft status for months and a task to update vault passwords due to the recent LastPass breach.

We also have work nearly complete enabling contractor deploy for Princeton Geniza Project. The issue is not tracked here because the pull request is still under review, but the new setup was used successfully for version 4.12 of Geniza listed below.

## Demos
