This iteration, we completed a lot of design and development work on Lenape. We also made progress on PPA, but there is a complicated group of related features that needs a few small changes after the most recent round of testing; we hope to complete those and deliver them to production in the coming iteration. The low development velocity (**3 points**) is consistent over the last few weeks, but significantly impacted by the amount of team member time spent on teaching for Wintersession and H+DSI.
