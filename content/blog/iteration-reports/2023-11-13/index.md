As part of a deadline for demoing the Lenape Timetree project for the Munsee language symposium, we worked on some updates and bugfixes and released an update to the theme.

On Simulating Risk, we continued to refine the hawk/dove simulation and worked on batch run analysis. We also fixed a synchronicity bug identified by a philosopher that we consulted with and started working on adding more configurability to various neighborhoods, which will add more parameters for batch analysis.


## Demos
