This iteration we were primarily focused on Geniza, but did devote some efforts towards Startwords. Our development velocity has stabilized a bit: 13 points, 20 issues, for a rolling velocity of 13.

## Geniza

We released another update (version 4.2) with more new features and improvements to the public site. The most visible change is the filter panel on the [document search](https://geniza.princeton.edu/en/documents/), which now includes three new filters related to scholarship records.  We're also making progress on designs and backend support for the RTL versions of the site.

## Startwords

This iteration we made some small progress on design and infrastructure updates needed for Issue 3.
