This iteration our focus was entirely on the Princeton Geniza Project as we worked to address issues identified in the 4.0 release that we wanted to address before switching the site to the official https://geniza.princeton.edu url (which we did on Thursday!).

Notable work completed in this iteration includes:
- completion of design work on the new logo and logotype (shown below), which will be integrated into the site this week.
- search results now include image thumbnails when available
- an admin document merge function, so that duplicate documents and joins can be merged manually in the admin site instead of relying on spreadsheets and script to handle merging (we discovered the script method was error-prone since merging needs to be done carefully)
