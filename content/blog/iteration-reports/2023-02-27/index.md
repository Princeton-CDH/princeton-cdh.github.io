At long last, we finally completed the PPA issues for clustering search results by default, after multiple rounds of testing, and addressing a few regressions introduced by the changes.
A new version of parasolr (0.9) has been released with the needed grouping functionality,
and we expect to release a new version of PPA with the functionality early this iteration.

On the Lenape Timetree project, we've made tremendous progress on design work for leaves in various states and other interactions, and saw some progress on improving the layout of the tree (multiline labels, adjusted leaf sizes, adjusted sizing for century bands.)

Because of the large PPA work that was finally completed, we closed **12** development points for a rolling velocity of **6.67** â€” up significantly from preceding iterations, but probably higher than we expect going forward.
