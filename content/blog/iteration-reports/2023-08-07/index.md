We're a small team working on multiple projects at once. We made significant progress on the **geotaste** tool, and work has ramped up in intensity with plans to complete the prototype by the end of August.  We also continued making progress on the simulations for the **Simulating Risk** project, completing a revision to one simulation and a new histogram chart.  We also completed some maintenance work on the **CDH website** to upgrade some dependencies, and released a micro version with those changes.
