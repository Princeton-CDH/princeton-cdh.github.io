We had another very productive iteration; we had **18** points total accepted on the Princeton Geniza Project, and we completed **18** development points. This results in a rolling development velocity of **15.7** points, continuing our upward trend. We closed a total of 23 development issues, which includes a high number of chores and bugs; some of these were on other projects.

## Princeton Geniza Project

The high number of points this iteration is largely due to significant progress on the transcription migration and new transcription editor functionality. We did also address some small bugs and other minor fixes; we did not release these changes to production during the iteration because we decided to prioritize other things, including making progress on the transcription editor. 

## CDH website

We needed to update the CDH website so that Humanities + Data Science Institute instructors and participants could be included on our affiliates pages. We also corrected a few small bugs and accessibility problems in the process.

## PPA

No development activity, but the remaining issues completed in the previous iteration were accepted. The completed work should be released and deployed early this iteration.

## S&co

We squeezed in two very minor updates to the Shakespeare and Company site; we hope these also will be released and deployed early this iteration.
