This iteration we completed implementation of the MVP for the new image + transcription viewing panel on the document details page on the Princeton Geniza Project site.  Specific features completed include image zoom controls (zoom is no longer enabled by default, which resolves some accessibility problems and avoids making the zoom a scroll trap) and switching between editions when a document has more than one transcription. We also completed work on a revised tag style, a change which was needed to properly handle accessibility checks and making sure that tags are always big enough tap targets.  Although we completed the MVP functionality for the new viewer, we were delayed with releasing it to the production site due to a change in the interim transcription format and problems synchronizing transcriptions for documents with more than one edition, which requires data work to resolve.

We completed 7 points of development work (10 issues) for a rolling velocity of 9.3; design work was impacted by staff unavailability.
