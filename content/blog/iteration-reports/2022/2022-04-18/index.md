This iteration we made progress on the remaining multilingual functionality and other features needed to publish *Startwords* issue 3. We didn't close a lot of points on the Geniza project because the major work going on at this point is prototyping and beginning to implement the new transcription functionality, and sketching out design ideas for the public display and interaction of images with transcription and translation content. Our rolling development velocity is **4.67**, due to the low number of points completed in the last two iterations (3, 4). We expect this to pick up once we move out of the transcription prototyping phase and finish work on the Startwords issue.
