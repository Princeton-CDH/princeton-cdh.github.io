Belated report on the first iteration of January 2022. This was effectively a long iteration, since it included work completed during the week of January 17th, which was a scheduled R&D week for CDH staff.

Our focus continues to be exclusively on Geniza, as we work closer and closer to completing the initial MVP that will be made public. We made tremendous progress on completing design work for site visuals, implementing the designs, finishing some of the final remaining functionality, and resolving a number of small bugs and chores that needed to be addressed.

We closed 21 development issues, for a total of 11 story points and a rolling velocity of 17.3.
