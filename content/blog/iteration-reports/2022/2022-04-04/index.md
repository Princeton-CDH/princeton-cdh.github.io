This iteration we worked on needed functionality for *Startwords* Issue 3, and made more progress prototyping and testing functionality for a transcription solution for the Geniza project. Because much of the development work consisted of chores, exploratory or prototyping, our iteration velocity and rolling velocity are both fairly low. We did make significant progress with Design work, both for Geniza and Startwords.
