At long last, we tagged and released the 4.0 version of Princeton Geniza Project! This is meets our agreement for a "Minimum Viable Product" to replace the current PGP v3.0. The new site isn't publicly available just yet, but we're planning to turn off IP access restriction by Thursday of this week at the latest and hoping to switch it to the official URL within another week.

We closed **24** development issues this iteration, but only completed **8** story points â€” likely because much of our focus was on finishing implementing visual designs, fixing bugs, and finishing chores in preparation for this release. Our rolling development velocity is 20 points, due to the huge iteration in December and the fact that we're no longer counting the zero-point iteration around Thanksgiving.

The mep-django releases were related to publication of the 1.2 version of the Shakespeare and Company Project datasets, which were published on Princeton's DataSpace on January 31st.
