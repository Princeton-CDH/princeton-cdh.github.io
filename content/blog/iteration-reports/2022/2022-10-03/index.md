We had a massive iteration, as we make a push to complete the major remaining 
deliverables on the Princeton Geniza Project before the partnership grant ends.
We also made some small progress on the Lenape timetree project. We completed
**48** total points and closed **35** issues for the Geniza project.
Looking just at development work, we **24** development points across
the same number of issues, and our rolling development velocity is
at **18.7**. For design, we closed an astounding **25** points, all on Geniza. 


## Princeton Geniza Project

On the development side, we're making the last push to complete the steps needed to migrate the transcription content and launch the new transcription editor. This included a number of improvements to the editor, as well as the majority of the implementation of the functionality for backing up and versioning transcription content on GitHub. We fixed a bug in the Arabic to Judaeo-Arabic search syntax that was breaking exact phrase searching in Arabic. We also addressed several small accessibility problems that were flagged by the University's new scanning tool, DubBot. For design, work completed
includes Arabic fonts and typography. Design work closed this iteration also includes a number of issues
related to site flow and preliminary designs for the cluster search,
which were designed in a previous iteration (before we decided to postpone that work),
and were reviewed and closed at the beginning of this iteration.

We did not release a new version of the PGP site this iteration, but expect to release an update in the first half of this iteration and go live with the transcription migration and editor.

## Lenape timetree 

We completed a task to improve the summary display of imported "leaf" data; the design work for sitemap and site flow was not yet being tracked in GitHub. Other improvements to the prototype site and design  are ongoing.
