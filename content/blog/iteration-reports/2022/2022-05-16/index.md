We released Geniza v4.4 early in this iteration to deliver work completed in the previous iteration, and then quickly discovered and fixed a bug with the menu button that made the site unnavigable on mobile. We did not get another release out during the iteration.

## Geniza
We made progress on a number of design and development issues and both rolling velocity and iteration development work are at **6 points**.  This doesn't reflect the large amount of in-progress work on transcription functionality (delivered for first-round testing but still very much in progress) and several related features around date/calendar conversion.

## Startwords

No development work this iteration, but design work for issue 3 is nearly complete and editorial and design work will be ready soon for final handoff for development on the remaining items needed for completing this issue.
