Our rolling development velocity after this iteration is picking up (7.8) as geniza work gains momentum. For development work, we completed 21 issues and 13 points. We made what we hope to be the final Derrida release.

## geniza

We made progress on the public document search, implementing styles and typography, and a preliminary implementation for synchronizing TEI transcriptions for search and display on the new site.

## derrida

We developed a custom driver for browsertrix-crawler so that we could archive the historgram visualization pages and the deep-zoom image content on the site.
