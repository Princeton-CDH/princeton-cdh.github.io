This iteration we closed 9 development issues but had zero points, because those issues were all chores and bugs. Our rolling velocity is **5.67** but should pick up as we gain momentum on geniza work, especially since we've added contractor developers to help out.

We had a **cdh web** bugfix release that addressed two bugs, and a **derrida** release with the code for the final data exports.  We're ramping up on **geniza** work for the fall, which is reflected in the number of issues closed, including some frontend setup work, planning, and progress on design for content pages and document detail page.
