This iteration we completed 18 development points on Geniza as we work towards a first release and migrating the metadata from the spreadsheet to the new relational database. We also completed a smattering of bugfixes and chores as part of planned maintenance work, and one unplanned bugfix. The 18 point total brings our rolling velocity up to 13.

## Princeton Geniza Project

Notable development work completed this iteration are related to scholarship record data import and editing functionality, as well as handling demerge on import and improving the admin document search. For design, we made progress on content pages, updates to the auto-layout in Figma, and progress on typefaces, even though no design issues were closed this iteration.

## Princeton Prosody Archive

Planned maintenance work on PPA included an update to switch out the frontend library Semantic UI, which is no longer being maintained, for the community fork, Fomantic UI. The other notable change is an improvement to hover and focus styles, for better accessibility and consistency.

## CDH Website

We released minor update with a trivial bugfix to address something we missed in the 3.0 release, so that content editors can customize the preview text displayed for blog posts. We also closed a few more bug issues that are no longer relevant now that we've switched from Mezzanine to Wagtail.
