Our rolling development velocity after this iteration is low (only **4 points**), but we're starting to gain momentum on the geniza development work and we'rec lose to wrapping up maintenance and chore work.  For development work, we completed 17 issues and 9 points; we also made progress on geniza design work this iteration.

## geniza

We're starting to make progress on the public site features planned for the first public release (PGP v4.0): adding functionality to the public document search, document details, implementing styles, and working to use localization and internationalization consistently. We're also making progress on visual design and typography.

## derrida

For the work to archive Derrida's Margins, we completed the remaining work to complete the web archiving (which included a custom web driver to capture the visualization and deep zoom images), and gathered needed information for customizing and configuring the deployed archive site.

## startwords

Startwords is not scheduled for active development until next iteration, but as we identified and addressed one small item that was determined to be helpful for editing and publication prep; in  this case, so the editors could give contributors a preview of how their revised essay might be presented on the site.
