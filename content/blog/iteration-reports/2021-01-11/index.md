Due to the holidays and planned vacations, we decided to take a long iteration spanning from December 14th to the end of the first week in January.

We spent the majority of the time on maintenance and addressing some technical debt. The CDH website was successfully moved from Research Computing and a MySQL database to its new home on a PUL VM and running on the PUL Postgresql database server. We're also making progress on CDH web 3.0, which involves the transition (which we've decided to call "exodus" to avoid confusion with "migration") from Mezzanine to Wagtail.

This iteration we also finally successfully addressed the problem in PPA for adding new HathiTrust content. The release was tagged December 22nd, along with a supporting release of parasolr, but rather than deploy an update right before the holidays, it was held. That release will go into production early this iteration.


## Demos
* The [CDH website](https://cdh.princeton.edu) v2.8.1 update was largely an infrastructural one, so there is little that is visible to display and we expect and want it to look it exactly as before.
  * One visible change: emoji are now supported! See [Marina's post on dates and dating](https://cdh.princeton.edu/updates/2020/11/18/dating-problems-ask-princeton-geniza-project-team/) to see the emojis she originally included, which were not supported on the previous version of the site.
