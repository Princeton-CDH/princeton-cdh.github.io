Belated iteration report, due to vacations last week. We closed a lot of development work (16 points, 23 issues); this is likely due to the transcription editor functionality that was tested and accepted and the number of small chores in the final push to get Startwords issue 3 out the door.

## Startwords

We finally published [Startwords issue 3](https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/issues/3/)! GitHub issues completed in this iteration were chores related to getting the release out and quick bug fixes to address problems we discovered after the issue was published.

## Geniza

Version 4.6 went into production, with the new image + transcription viewer. We also tested closed a number of features related to the transcription editor.

## PPA

We started ramping back up on PPA development work this iteration, beginning with some python package updates and a few small chores.
