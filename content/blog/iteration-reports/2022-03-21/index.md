This iteration our focus again was solely on the Geniza project. We put out a bug-fix release early in the iteration to address several highly noticeable problems that were identified by various members of the team, and then a feature release with new functionality, most notably implementing Turbo and Stimulus to make the document search more responsive and load changes more quickly. We also made some small changes to the document details page, including displaying primary and secondary languages, linking to other documents on the same fragments, and moving secondary metadata lower on the page.

Our development rolling velocity is steady at **13 points**, although this iteration we only closed **7** story points. However, that's in line with what we should expect, since it was effectively a half iteration in terms of developer staffing.
