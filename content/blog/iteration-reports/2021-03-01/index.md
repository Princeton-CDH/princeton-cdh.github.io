This iteration we continued to make progress on building out the new relational database for the Geniza project and importing existing data from spreadsheets. Database structure, admin interface, and data import for languages & scripts are complete; data import for library collections are complete but the admin editing story is not yet complete due to changes in the requirements. Database structure, and admin interface for documents and fragments are underway and far enough along to share a list of questions and necessary data work for the import to proceed, but have not yet been delivered for testing. In terms of design work, issues were delivered with proposed sitemap for sign off and mockups for the structure and content of the document detail page, but neither were closed.

Progress on the CDH website migration continues, and while some testing took place this iteration no stories were accepted and completed. There are now eight issues (24 story points) awaiting testing, up from the seven issues (18 points) reported at the beginning of the end of the last iteration. This could be due to a new acceptance tester learning the process combined with complicated issues, but it raises concerns, especially since some issues have already been tested more than once and are not yet accepted.
