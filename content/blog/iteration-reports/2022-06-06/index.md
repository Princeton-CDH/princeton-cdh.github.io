We adjusted the schedule to make the past iteration a three-week iteration due to the Memorial holiday resulting in a very short week. Due to holidays, team member availability, and the chunks of work that are in progress, we didn't publish any releases, but we did complete a lot of work. Our development velocity is up to **9.3** points (14 points, 21 issues). We have the same exact velocity for design work (**9.3**), with 12 points and 7 issues closed.

## Geniza

Major design work closed related to the new image and transcription panel, for which implementation are underway. We also completed designs for the related documents page.  We also finished work on a number of features related to date filtering and historical calendar conversion, which we hope to make available in production soon.

## Startwords

We completed much of the remaining work needed for issue 3, including: revised shadow text styles for the site homepage and single issue pages (pictured below), generalized the interlude styles invented for SW issue 1 so it can be used in any article in future; improved DOI display for translated articles; and fixed a couple of bugs.

## cdh-ansible

A small improvement in our project deploy scripts, suggested by PUL staff, resulted in a huge improvement in the time it takes to deploy projects, by configuring the deploy scripts to skip one-time setup tasks by default.
