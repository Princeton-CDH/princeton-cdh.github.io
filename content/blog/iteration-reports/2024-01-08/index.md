In the last iteration of 2023, we made significant progress on multiple maintenance projects and completed a major feature on PPA looking towards research planned for 2024. 

* **PPA**: We completed work on a new script to export a full-text corpus with page-level content corresponding to what's available on the public site in Solr. 
* **Shakespeare and Company Project**: We released a new version of the django web application, which included important maintenance updates and some bug fixes. 
* **VM upgrades and load-balancing**: We worked with PUL to upgrade VMs (from bionic to jammy) and load-balance several of our applications, in both QA/staging and Production environments. As part of this work, we closed out a number of issues related to our ansible deploys. The cdhweb micro release was also related to this upgrade.
* **Simulating Risk**: We completed development on the remaining prioritized simulation updates to address flaws or add robustness checks, but due to the holidays they have not yet been reviewed and accepted.
