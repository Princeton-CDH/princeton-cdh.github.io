This iteration, on the Simulating Risk project we completed review and acceptance testing of the last planned issues for refining the model to address known flaws and improve robustness, including an option to set initial risk attitudes based on different distributions (random, normal, skewed left or right, bimodal).

On PPA, we did a substantial amount of cleanup on GitHub in preparation for the upcoming work; we closed one chore completed in this iteration, and a few issues that we discovered have been resolved. We closed a large number of old issues (bugs and features both) that we've decided not to work on since they are not aligned with our priorities for the project. (These are tagged as "wontfix" and are not reflected in the totals for the iteration, since we did not work on them.)

Our rolling velocity is **4.3**, which likely reflects somewhat slow progress on both development and testing due to holidays and other commitments in January, as well as the amount of time we've been spending on project planning and maintenance.
