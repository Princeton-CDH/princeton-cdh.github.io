We had a productive iteration, making good progress on both Princeton Geniza Project and Princeton Prosody Archive (PPA). We closed *13* development points (18 issues); with three strong iterations in a row, we're up to a rolling development velocity of *12* points. We didn't close design issues, but that's because we have larger design tasks in progress.

## Geniza

We released version 4.7, which includes some content editor improvements for tagging; improved display for non-document images in the image+transcription panel viewer for documents; the newly designed light/dark mode toggle was also implemented.

## PPA

We completed the remaining work on Gale/ECCO import and support that was leftover from last year's enhancements, in particular: admin import for small batches,
excerpt support for Gale/ECCO works, and data improvements that were delayed pending API changes on Gale's end. We started on functionality to group works into clusters to gather reprints and editions. We also did some other minor updates to improve performance, accessibility, and make the site more consistent.

## Other

- updated the Startwords site with fixes for a couple of small display issues
- created a new organization-wide GitHub template for our team software release checklist (previously tracked as a template task in Asana)
