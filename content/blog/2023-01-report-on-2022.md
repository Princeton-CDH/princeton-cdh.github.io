The charts below show the substantial amount of effort dedicated to the Princeton Geniza Project in 2022, with a noticeable spike as we worked to complete our commitments on the project before the charter period ended in October. 

There's also noticeable activity on Startwords to finish publication on issue 3; work on PPA enhancements in August and November/December; and beginning to ramp up work on the Lenape Timetree project in the fall.

The small amount of work spent on CDH web and mep-django (codebase for Shakepeare and Company Project) reflect a deliberate effort to minimize the work on those projects.
