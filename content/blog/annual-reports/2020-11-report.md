Our biggest sustained efforts in 2020 have been on mep-django, leading up to the Shakespeare and Company Project 1.0 release in May and _Startwords_, leading up to the October launch of issue 1. We also worked on PEMM in January to migrate and support data entry work, and finished agreed upon commitments to wrap the grant year in July.
