A belated look back at the work we did in 2021. The substantial effort on CDH web reflects the work to migrate to Wagtail for content management. We completed a substantial amount of work on the Princeton Geniza Project across the whole year, a set of enhancements for PPA in July, and a small amount of work on Startwords to publish issue 2. The work on the derrida-django codebase in the fall was to revise the published datasets and prep the side for archiving.
